 Rock-chinned New Zealander will represent a formidable foe when Anthony Joshua 
 attempts to add a third world title to his collection in Saturday?s heavyweight 
 showdown in Cardiff  When Anthony Joshua said he wanted to clean up the 
 heavyweight division, he surely did not intend to be mistaken for the Dalai 
 Lama. Yet, in the months, weeks and days leading up to Friday?s weigh-in 
 at Cardiff, prayer meetings have generated more friction than that between 
 the world champion and his well-mannered New Zealand guest, Joseph Parker, 
 who stands between the Watford man and the ultimate cleansing of the business, 
 against the American Deontay Wilder and then, perhaps, Tyson Fury.  That 
 is some way off. For now, we have an argument over three of the four recognised 
 world title belts between two polite gentleman pugilists whose respect for 
 each other borders on friendship, and it moves smoothly towards resolution 
 in front of 80,000 fans at the Principality Stadium on Saturday night.

 A toxic atmosphere at the London Stadium has led to heightened security for 
 Saturday?s relegation match against Southampton  In different circumstances 
 it would be possible simply to look forward to a day of huge significance 
 at the bottom of the Premier League. If life at the London Stadium was that 
 straightforward, however, they would not be fortifying security in front 
 of the directors? box and there would be no clamour for the trio running 
 West Ham United to stay away from home games for the rest of the season. 
  The future has arrived in less than glorious circumstances, humbling West 
 Ham as they prepare to host Southampton on Saturday afternoon. The promised 
 dream has turned into a nightmare in a soulless bowl. It has been three 
 weeks since West Ham?s last game descended into chaos and it is hardly ideal 
 they have spent that time working with the authorities to prevent a repeat 
 of the ugly scenes that marred their 3-0 defeat against Burnley.   Continue

 Trump freezing Syria funds in signal of US pullback, report says
summary: 
text1:   
 President Donald Trump is freezing more than $200 million in funds for recovery 
 efforts in war-torn Syria amid a reassessment of the role the U.S. should 
 play in the drawn-out conflict there, The Wall Street Journal reported on 
 Friday. The White House ordered the State Department to put the funds on 
 hold, the report said. According to The Journal, Trump did so after reading 
 a news report saying that the U.S. had recently committed an additional 
 $200 million to early recovery efforts. Exiting Secretary of State Rex Tillerson

 So it all comes down to, who are the fact-checkers? A Facebook employee stated

 You can see the list of signatories at the link; the only one that I recognize 
 as more or less conservative is the Weekly Standard. Facebook has already 
 said that it will use Politifact and Snopes, both left-leaning, as fact 
 checkers. At the press conference, it got even worse: In the US, we recently

 For many years now, the celebrated thespian Sean Penn has been one of the 
 wackiest activists in the pantheon of the Hollywood left. When we last observed 
 him in his unnatural habitat, he was warmly interviewing the murderous drug 
 lord &#x22;El Chapo&#x22; for Rolling Stone and insisting the drug lord 
 is demonized in the war on drugs. Now Penn thinks he is not just a journalist 
 but a novelist. Right before the 2016 election, he narrated an audiobook 
 titled &#x22;Bob Honey Who Just Do Stuff&#x22; under the pseudonym &#x22;Pappy 
 Pariah.&#x22; Simon &#x26; Schuster has now published it in book form...

 Ari Melber Claps Back With Rap Lyrics At Roger Stone
summary: 
text1:   
 For those of our readers who are not familiar with Ari Melber, he is a brilliant 
 lawyer and journalist who hosts a nightly show on MSNBC at 6pm called The 
 Beat. He also  loves rap music.  No, really, he  loves rap.   A lot.    
 
 So it is no shock to hear him drop some lyrics in response to a personal 
 attack by self proclaimed "Dirty Trickster," lover of hair plugs and 80's 
 pimp-suit style, Roger Stone.  Here is what Ari had to share on Friday's 
 episode: 
  MELBER: Bob Mueller is asking Trump allies about Julian Assange 
 and just detained a new witness, questioning him at an airport on Wednesday. 
 This investigative interest in Assange overlaps with the report we did last 
 night on "The Beat" probing Trump adviser Roger Stone's relationship to 
 WikiLeaks. That report broke news and drew a heated response from Stone 
 today. Several outlets have been covering that. Roger Stone posted a new 
 video right there on Instagram while smoking a cigar with his grandson. 
 In it he attacks his former protege Sam Nunberg.  Stone said those associates 
 who called him a liar, they are actually the liars. He was responding to 
 some of this:   read more

 above the beast is not the cudgel but an inward music: the irresistible 
 power of unarmed truth.&#x22;

 Associated Press/LM Otero    
 
  A federal judge issued an injunction that 
 prevents the federal government from interfering with the ability of undocumented 
 teenagers in U.S. custody to have abortions or obtain abortion-related services. 
  
  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services previously enacted 
 a policy that prohibited federally funded shelters from taking "any action 
 that facilitates" abortions without approval.  
  The government can appeal. 
  
 
 
  A federal judge in Washington issued an injunction on Friday preventing 
 the Trump administration from interfering with the ability of undocumented

 Kiran was supposed to be visited by a gynecologist, who was on the phone

 What&#x27;s the Deal with SpaceX, NOAA and Live Rocket Launch Video?
summary: 
text1:   
 9 minutes into an otherwise routine Falcon 9 launch of 10 Iridium Next communications 
 satellites from California&#x27;s Vandenberg Air Force Base, SpaceX cut 
 the feed. The video blackout was intentional because of &#x22;restrictions&#x22; 
 from a U.S. government agency known for its own live views of Earth from 
 space. Those restrictions, Space.com has learned, apparently hinge on a 
 recent NOAA assertion that the cameras on SpaceX&#x27;s Falcon 9 second 
 stage can qualify as a &#x22;remote sensing space system,&#x22; which would 
 require a provisional license from the U.S. agency if SpaceX wanted to show 
 the live video and still launch on time....

 Dem Rep Garamendi: I Think Mueller Will Find Proof Trump Camp Worked with 
 Russians to Alter Outcome of Election
summary: 
text1:  
 On Friday&#8217;s edition of CNN&#8217;s &#8220;The Lead,&#8221; Representative 
 John Garamendi (D-CA) stated that while there isn&#8217;t clear evidence 
 yet, &#8220;I think we&#8217;re going to find the proof&#8221; that the 
 Trump campaign worked with the Russians to influence the election, &#8220;and 
 I think the man that&#8217;ll find proof is Mueller.&#8221; Garamendi said, 
 &#8220;[W]e&#8217;re finding more and more information every day that the 
 Trump campaign is being closer and closer identified in a collusion with 
 the Russians to influence the outcome of the election. Now, the evidence 
 isn&#8217;t exactly clear yet. But I must tell you, it is one thing after 
 another, and it&#8217;s coming to the point where, yeah, there is collusion.&#8221; 
 He added, &#8220;What is believable is that they were working with the Russians 
 to somehow influence the outcome of the campaign. I think we&#8217;re going 
 to find the proof of it, and I think the man that&#8217;ll find that proof 
 is Mueller. And that&#8217;s why there&#8217;s so much talk about getting 
 rid of him, somehow firing him, firing the people that could fire him so 
 that new people would be put in that could fire him. This has got to be 
 a major problem for America. We need to know

 THE SELF-INSTALLED SMART HOME REPORT: Why current smart home device owners 
 are appealing to tech companies
summary: 
text1:   
 This is a preview of a research report from BI Intelligence, Business Insider's 
 premium research service. To learn more about BI Intelligence,  click here 
 .   
  Not that long ago, many home-appliance and consumer-electronics makers 
 were gearing up for what they thought would soon be a rapidly growing market 
 for smart home devices.   
  The instant popularity of the Nest thermostat, 
 introduced in 2011, seemed to&nbsp;  confirm&nbsp; their hopes   . But those 
 expectations were dashed in the coming years as the market for connected 
 home devices later stagnated.&nbsp;  
 Even with these challenges, many 
 of the biggest consumer technology companies are now moving into the smart 
 home market.  For example, Apple, which recently released its self-installed 
 smart home ecosystem, called the Apple Home, traditionally doesn't move 
 into a market until it's very mature and only when it can release a perfected 
 product. Further, Google this fall launched the Google Home and its companion 
 ecosystem, hoping to jump into the voice-activated smart home speaker market, 
 which Amazon currently dominates with its Echo product line.&nbsp;  
 In 
 a new report, BI Intelligence examines the demographics of the average smart 
 home device owner and discuss why current smart home device owners are appealing 
 to tech companies. The report also&nbsp;examines the plans of various tech 
 giants in the smart home market and discuss their monetization strategies, 
 and makes suggestions for how these companies can position themselves to 
 make their products and devices more appealing to the mass market. 
   Here 
 are some key takeaways from the report:   
 
 Tech companies primarily enter 
 the market to enhance a core revenue stream or service, while device makers 
 desire to collect data to improve their products and prevent costly recalls. 
 
 We forecast there&nbsp;will be $4.8 trillion in aggregate IoT investment 
 between 2016 and 2021. 
 These companies are also seeking to create an early-mover 
 advantage for themselves, where they gain an advantage by this head start 
 on adoption. 
 Major barriers to mass market adoption that still must overcome 
 include technological fragmentation and persistently high device prices. 
 
 
   In full, the report:   
 
 Details the market strategy of prominent 
 tech companies and device makers, and analyzes why which ones are best poised 
 to succeed once adoption ticks up. 
 Offers insight into current ownership 
 through an exclusive survey from BI Intelligence and analyzes what demographics 
 will drive adoption moving forward. 
 Explains in detail which companies 
 are poised to succeed in the market in the coming years as adoption increases 
 and mass market consumers begin to purchase smart home devices.

 attention. Even though the siren was loud and alarm lights were noticeably 
 flashing, most people kept on working out. With their Air Buds and ear buds 
 blasting music and eyes glued to the morning news shows, they continued 
 pumping iron, running on the treadmill, and staying in the plank position 
 so that the core would be as tight as possible.

 President Trump reportedly warned Russian President Vladimir Putin during

 Putin&#x27;s claim of new nuclear-capable weapons that can reach the United

 to one official. &#x22;If you want to have an arms race we can do that,

 Donny Deutsch on Ingraham: ?We Can?t Have Animals on the Air Attacking Children?
summary: 
text1:  
 On Friday&#8217;s broadcast of MSNBC&#8217;s &#8220;Morning Joe,&#8221; author, 
 branding and marketing expert, and radio host Donny Deutsch weighed in on 
 the controversy over Fox News host Laura Ingraham&#8217;s comments on Parkland 
 survivor David Hogg by stating, &#8220;We can?t have animals on the air 
 attacking children.&#8221; Co-host Joe Scarborough began the discussion 
 by stating that a 4.1 GPA isn&#8217;t something worthy of mockery, and he 
 doesn&#8217;t understand why people would attack high school students or 
 why they think that would work politically. Deutsch responded that Ingraham&#8217;s 
 comments lacked basic human empathy or sympathy. He added, &#8220;Laura 
 Ingraham told LeBron James to &#8216;shut up and dribble.&#8217; And Laura 
 Ingraham needs to just shut up and dribble also. She?s a reprehensible human 
 being. And the good news here is, the advertisers will speak, and they will 
 continue. You might see Laura Ingraham saying, &#8216;Bye-bye.'&#8221; Scarborough 
 then said that people make mistakes, and Ingraham apologized sincerely. 
 Deutsch responded that while we all make mistakes, &#8220;when it&#8217;s 
 a serial behavior, and the apology was only for one reason: because she 
 was losing advertisers. &#8230; And her behavior stands for itself. And, 
 you know, there&#8217;s &#8212; we can all argue about politics, but there&#8217;s 
 just human

summary:

 Friday on Fox News Chanel&#8217;s &#8220;Fox &#38; Friends,&#8221; former 
 House Speaker Newt Gingrich said the success of the ?Roseanne? premiere, 
 which had over 18 million viewers, showed President Donald Trump would not 
 be easy to beat in his 2020 re-election bid. Gingrich said, &#8220;Every 
 once in a while Hollywood makes a movie appeals to middle America. It does 
 amazingly well. They won&#8217;t make a second movie, though because that is 
 not how you get Oscars. You get Oscars by being anti-American, left-wing 
 and cynical. So the culture of Hollywood is always surprised.&#8221; He 
 added, &#8220;I think it is great she is doing so well. I think it is frankly 
 funny she is pro-Trump, openly so. She is being successful. I think there 
 is a message there. For those people that think Trump will be easy to beat 
 in 2020 they ought to sit down and chat with Roseanne.&#8221; Follow Pam

 Judge grants nationwide right to abortion to illegal immigrant minors
summary: 
text1:   
 A federal judge ordered the Trump administration late Friday to grant pregnant 
 illegal immigrant girls in U.S. custody unfettered access to abortions, 
 ruling they have a constitutional right to the procedure. Judge Tanya Chutkan, 
 an Obama appointee to U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., who has been 
 a thorn in the side of the Trump administration in several major cases, 
 said that the government has been creating too many hurdles in the path 
 of the teen girls.

 Tesla reveals the driver killed in a Model X crash was traveling with Autopilot

 KTVU via Associated Press    
 
  A Tesla Model X destroyed in a fiery crash 
 that also killed the driver had been operating on Autopilot moments before 
 the collision, Tesla announced on Friday night, citing information collected 
 from vehicle logs.  
  The company said the driver had set a distance-control 
 feature that determines how much space the Model X keeps between itself 
 and other vehicles to the "minimum" setting.  
  Tesla also asserts that 
 the driver had received "several visual and one audible hands-on warning," 
 and their hands were not detected on the wheel "six seconds prior to the 
 collision."  
 
 
 Tesla revealed new information about a collision involving 
 a Model X, in which the driver of the electric SUV was killed last week. 
 
 The company  said in a blog post  on Friday night that the Model X had 
 been operating on Autopilot, its semi-autonomous driving system, before 
 the crash, according to data obtained from onboard vehicle logs. The driver 
 had also set a distance-control feature that determines how much space the 
 Model X keeps between itself and other vehicles to the "minimum" setting, 
 the company said.    See the rest of the story at Business Insider   NOW

 THE INSURTECH REPORT 2.0: The technologies disrupting the insurance industry 
 and what incumbents can do to stay ahead
summary: 
text1:   
 BI Intelligence   Tech-driven disruption in the insurance industry continues 
 at pace, and we're now entering a new phase &mdash;&nbsp;the adaptation 
 of underlying business models.&nbsp; 
 That's leading to ongoing changes 
 in the distribution segment of the industry, but more excitingly, we are 
 starting to see movement in the&nbsp;fundamentals of insurance &mdash; policy 
 creation, underwriting, and claims management.&nbsp; 
 This report from 
  Business Insider Intelligence , Business Insider's premium research service, 
 will briefly review major changes in the insurtech segment over the past 
 year. It will then examine how startups and legacy players across the insurance 
 value chain are using technology to develop new business models that cut 
 costs or boost revenue, and, in some cases, both. Additionally, we will 
 provide our take on the future of insurance as insurtech continues to proliferate.&nbsp;

 Laura Ingraham doesn&#x92;t really want to debate David Hogg
summary: 
text1:   
 Two reasons could explain Laura Ingraham&#x27;s decision to mock Parkland 
 shooting survivor David Hogg for his college rejections. One is schadenfreude, 
 but it is seems overly cynical to think that the Fox News host takes pleasure 
 in watching more bad things happen to a teenager who lost 14 schoolmates 
 and three educators last month. The other, more plausible reason is that 
 Ingraham wants to remove Hogg from a national conversation about gun control. 
 Rather than debate him, she would prefer to disqualify him.

 Tesla reveals the driver killed in a Model X crash was traveling with Autopilot 
 engaged, received 'several' automated warnings before the collision
summary: 
text1:  
 A Tesla Model X destroyed in a fiery crash that also killed the driver had 
 been operating on Autopilot moments before the collision, Tesla announced 
 on Friday night, citing information collected from vehicle logs.  
  The 
 company said the driver had set a distance-control feature that determines 
 how much space the Model X keeps between itself and other vehicles to the 
 "minimum" setting.  
  Tesla also asserts that the driver had received "several 
 visual and one audible hands-on warning," and didn't have their hands on 
 the wheel "six seconds prior to the collision."  
 
 
 Tesla revealed new 
 information about a collision involving a Model X, in which the driver of 
 the electric SUV was killed. 
 The company  said in a blog post  on Friday 
 night that the Model X had been operating on Autopilot, its semi-autonomous 
 driving system, before the crash, according to data obtained from onboard 
 vehicle logs. The driver had also set a distance-control feature that determines 
 how much space the Model X keeps between itself and other vehicles to the 
 "minimum" setting. 
 According to Tesla, the driver had received "several 
 visual and one audible hands-on warning" during the drive, and did not have 
 their hands on the wheel "six seconds prior to the collision." 
 The Model 
 X slammed into a highway barrier in the Northern California city of Mountain 
 View on March 23. The driver later died at a hospital. 
 Tesla said the 
 driver "had about five seconds and 150 meters of unobstructed view of the 
 concrete divider with the crushed crash attenuator, but the vehicle logs 
 show that no action was taken." 
 The National Transportation Safety Board 
 (NTSB) is investigating. Two other vehicles were involved in the collision. 
 
 It was the second collision involving a Tesla operating on Autopilot so 
 far this year. The NTSB was also looking into  a Model S sedan that collided 
 with a fire truck  in the Los Angeles suburb of Culver City in January. 
 
 Tesla has said that "Autopilot is not a fully self-driving technology 
 and drivers need to remain attentive at all times." The Autopilot system 
 is designed to warn drivers whenever it detects that the driver's hands 
 are not on the wheel. The severity of those warnings gradually escalate 
 if the driver does not respond, and eventually deactivates itself.   SEE

 Let&#x27;s Build The Wall. How To DO IT !!
summary: 
text1:   
 ATTN: President Trump Let&#x27;s get that wall built, and here&#x27;s how 
 to do it. During WW II the government issued war bonds to finance military 
 operations and other expenditures in the time of war. The government took 
 in Billions of dollars from private citizens, so why can&#x27;t the government 
 issue WALL BONDS to build a wall to keep illegals and drugs out of America? 
 This is just a thought, and maybe worth consideration.

 Walmart Pulls Pro-Abortion &#x93;Cosmo&#x94; From Checkout Lines
summary: 
text1:   
 Walmart is removing the sex-obsessed, pro-abortion women&#x92;s magazine 
 &#x93;Cosmopolitan&#x94; from its checkout shelves. The retail chain announced 
 the change this week after considering concerns raised by parents and conservative 
 groups about the content of the magazine, USA Today reports. &#x93;While 
 this was primarily a business decision, the concerns raised were heard,&#x94; 
 Walmart spokesperson Meggan Kring said. &#x93;Cosmpolitan&#x94; often displays 
 scantily clad women on its front covers, along with headlines promoting 
 risky sexual behavior and other objectionable content. It also regularly 
 advocates for abortion on demand. Inside its pages, Cosmo has criticized 
 late-term abortion bans and justified eugenic abortions of disabled...

 NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert: Music as Pure Joy: Väsen
summary: 
text1:  
 March 23, 2018 | Bob Boilen --  
There's an abundance of jubilation and glee 
 in the strums, trills, double stops and drones from the Swedish instrumental 
 band Väsen. The trio came to the Tiny Desk with just three instruments, 
 but all together it was a 30-string sonic blast of 12-string guitar, viola 
 and nyckelharpa (a fiddle with keys ? think 15th century keytar). 

 Guitarist 
 Roger Tallroth, violist Mikael Marin and nyckelharpist Olov Johansson have 
 been a touring troupe for more than 25 years with 18 albums filled with 
 adventure, amusement and virtuosity. They span the wide emotional range 
 of Swedish folk music, equally haunting and celebratory. There are some 
 similarities to Irish jigs, reels and waltzes that I'm more familiar with, 
 but this music is more ear-bending, with more surprises than I'm used to 
 in traditional string band folk music. 

 Hopefully these tunes, many from 
 Väsen's recent album Brewed ? songs steeped in the past with its ears on 
 the future ? become a gateway for new listeners. 

 Set List 

 "IPA-Gubben" 
 
"Väsenvalsen" 
"Sommarpolska" 

 MUSICIANS 
Mikael Marin (5-string viola), 
 Olov Johansson (Nyckelharpa), Roger Tallroth (12-string guitar)

 'This guy has no idea what he's doing': Former Obama deputy rails against 
 Trump's pick for VA secretary
summary: 
text1:   
 MSNBC    
 
  President Barack Obama's former deputy chief of staff Jim Messina 
 criticized President Donald Trump's pick for Veterans Affairs secretary 
 on Friday, calling the nominee "the worst choice you could possibly imagine." 
  
  Trump nominated US Navy Rear Adm. Ronny Jackson to be his next Veterans 
 Affairs secretary on Wednesday.&nbsp;  
  Although he spoke highly of Jackson's 
 character, Messina said the doctor is unqualified to lead the US's second-largest 
 federal agency.  
 
 
  A former Obama official railed against President 
 Donald Trump's decision to nominate US Navy Rear Adm. Ronny Jackson as Veterans 
 Affairs secretary by offering an analogy that illustrated how he believes 
 Jackson is unqualified for the job. 
 Jim Messina, who once served as President 
 Barack Obama's deputy chief of staff, said that nominating Jackson, who 
 served as a physician under Obama and Trump and is now on deck to lead the 
 VA pending confirmation, "was the worst choice you could possibly imagine."

  The official PMI released on Saturday rose to 51.5 
 in March, from 50.3 in February.  
  Analysts surveyed by Reuters had forecast 
 the reading would pick up only slightly to 50.5.  
  The findings add to 
 a growing amount of data which suggest that China's economy has carried 
 more momentum into the first quarter from last year than analysts had expected. 
  
 
 
 BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China's manufacturing sector picked 
 up more than expected in March as authorities lifted winter pollution restrictions 
 and steel mills cranked up production as construction activity swings back 
 into high gear. 
 The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) released 
 on Saturday rose to 51.5 in March, from 50.3 in February, and was well above 
 the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.

 Zuccarello wants to be bridge to next great Rangers teams
summary: 
text1:

 John Tavares hitting this plateau couldn?t spark Islanders? win
summary: 
text1:   
 The Islanders got a look at what it takes to be a playoff team as their second-half 
 slide only worsened. Auston Matthews scored the tiebreaking goal with just 
 under four minutes remaining to lift the playoff-bound Maple Leafs to a

 Violet &#x26; White Double of the First Class A NIGHT HAS PASSED over the 
 Tomb, wherein lies buried the Body of the Man-God. Death is triumphant in 
 that silent cave, and hold captive Him that gives life to every creature&#xE2;&#x80;&#x94;but 
 his triumph will soon be at an end. The Soldiers may watch, as best they 
 will, over that Grave: they cannot hold Jesus prisoner, as soon as the moment 
 fixed for his Resurrection comes. The holy Angels are there, profoundly 
 adoring the lifeless Body of Him whose Blood is to reconcile all things, 
 both on earth, and in heaven....

 &#x27;I&#x27;ve got kids that are older than they are. Who thinks that attacking 
 children, who thinks that spreading false information about children which 
 has not only been spread on conspiracy sites but also on mainstream media

 it&#x27;s so obvious it&#x27;s only going to blow up in their faces?&#x27; 
 asked Scarborough. &#x27;Let&#x27;s add on attacking children who are two 
 weeks out from hiding under their desk or watching their friends be shot 
 by an automatic weapon,&#x27; pointed out Deutsch. So if you can&#x27;t 
 have empathy or sympathetic behavior...

 Have Black Panther and A Wrinkle in Time got black feminism all wrong?
summary: 
text1:  
 The trope of ?black girl magic? has gained box-office clout with recent films. 
 But despite its progressive message, some fear it will become a marketing 
 tool    Related:   Hidden figures: the history of Nasa?s black female scientists 
    Hollywood is having a black girl moment. That?s right, coloniser! Melanin 
 has been dripping off the big screen for little over a year, creating new 
 stars, new social media challenges ? and women have very much been at the 
 centre of it all, both in front and behind the camera. Hidden Figures, which 
 came out in the US in December 2016, told the true story of the three African-American 
 mathematicians who played a pivotal role in getting US spacecraft into orbit. 
 It made more than $200m globally. Then in the summer of 2017 came the brilliantly 
 bawdy comedy Girls Trip. Grossing more than $140m, the film introduced global 
 audiences to the actor  Tiffany Haddish , and provided an invaluable education 
 in the many uses of a grapefruit.   Continue reading...

 Jesse Jackson on Martin Luther King's assassination: 'It redefined America'
summary: 
text1:  
 The civil rights veteran, one of only two surviving witnesses to King?s murder 
 50 years ago, says his mentor?s response to Trump would have been: ?We must 
 not surrender our spirits?  Jesse Jackson still remembers the sound of the 
 gunshot and the sight of blood. They have been with him for half a century. 
 ?Every time I think about it, it?s like pulling a scab off a sore,? he says. 
 ?It?s a hurtful, painful thought: that a man of love is killed by hate; 
 that a man of peace should be killed by violence; a man who cared is killed 
 by the careless.?   Jackson and fellow civil rights veteran Andrew Young 
 are the last surviving disciples of Martin Luther King who witnessed his 
 assassination on 4 April 1968. Others who were at the Lorraine motel in 
 Memphis, Tennessee, that day have been claimed by the passing decades. And 
 each milestone anniversary has offered a snapshot of Jackson?s, and the 
 nation?s, jagged and jarringly uneven narratives.   Continue reading...

 Elena Ferrante: ?I make an effort never to exaggerate with an exclamation 
 mark?
summary: 
text1:  
 Of all the punctuation marks, it?s the one I like the least. It suggests 
 a commander?s staff, a pretentious obelisk, a phallic display  I try never 
 to raise my voice. Enthusiasm, anger, even pain I try to express with restraint, 
 tending towards self-mockery. And I admire those who maintain a calm demeanour 
 during an argument, who try to give cautious hints that we should lower 
 our voices, who reply to frantic questions ? ?Is it true it really happened 
 like that? Is it true?? ? simply with a yes or no, without exclamation marks. 
  Mainly, this is because I?m afraid of excesses ? mine and others?. Sometimes 
 people make fun of me. They say: ?You want a world without outbursts of 
 joy, suffering, anger, hatred?? Yes, I want precisely that, I answer. I 
 would like it if, on the entire planet, there were no longer any reason 
 to shout, especially with pain. I like low tones, polite enthusiasm, courteous 
 complaints.   Continue reading...

 Fit in my 40s: I?m doing a 5K ?fun run?. The 15Kers are scaring me | Zoe 
 Williams
summary: 
text1:  
 I was the only person who didn?t have water. Oh, and also, I never got beyond 
 week five in the eight-week Couch To 5K programme    Back in January when 
 I slogged up the inclines in St James?s Park in London  wondering how they 
 could be so vicious and yet so invisible, the celebrity trainer Matt Roberts 
 told me that you had to find your motivation in running. Not many people 
 enjoy it for its own sake. ?Is there a charity you really care about, something 
 you could support for a sponsored 5K?? he asked. Hard to know how to answer 
 this. It made me think of David Cameron (Roberts was his trainer, remember), 
 a feckless, unpatriotic man, indolently spoiling everything for everyone, 
 then taking a break to puff his way round civic spaces and congratulate 
 himself on his life choices, self-love cloaked in self-righteousness. ?Sponsored 
 runs make me feel sick,? I said, but Roberts could see I felt sick anyway 
 with the exertion and discreetly looked away.  I solved this ? did I solve 
 it? You decide ? by doing a run for a charity I didn?t care about and not 
 registering, just paying 20 quid on the day. It was the wrong choice, in 
 many ways, because it was a 5K, 10K and 15K run all setting off from the 
 same place, and I felt intimidated by the 10Kers and 15Kers, by everyone 
 in matching T-shirts, by the apparatus of the ?fun run? (loads of tape, 
 like a crime scene), and the fact that I was the only person who didn?t 
 have water. Oh, and also, I never got beyond week five in the eight-week 
  Couch To 5K programme . I had an injury, then there was the snow, then 
 there was more snow, and I ended up doing week five again and again.   Continue

 ?I am 24 and live with my parents but I?m on track to save £50,000 before 
 I?m 27?
summary: 
text1:  
 Analyst for a supermarket Rosie Burns reveals how she scrimps and saves £1,200 
 per month Since I was a teenager, I have always said I will own a property 
 by myself, and I have never lost sight of this vision. I should start by 
 saying that I?m fully aware of how extreme I am, and would never expect 
 anyone else to behave in such a ludicrous way. I also consider myself very 
 lucky to still live with my parents, which at 24 is becoming increasingly 
 common given the housing crisis. My point of this article therefore, is 
 to highlight to the older generation that even someone like myself, who 
 is in a fairly privileged position yet still goes to extreme lengths to 
 save money, is still in a futile position when it comes to climbing on to 
 the property ladder.  I have saved £20,000 in two years and I have still 
 enjoyed life to its fullest. In those two years I?ve travelled to Stockholm, 
 Copenhagen, Prague, Portugal, Croatia, Barcelona, Singapore, Bali, Switzerland, 
 Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Luxembourg and Paris. I am on a pretty average 
 London salary (around £30,000), and my weekends are normally spent going 
 out for brunch/lunch/dinner. I will never turn down a social event because 
 of money, I will buy clothes around once a month, and I drive a Nissan Micra.

 Calls for justice and charges against two police officers who fatally shot 
 an unarmed black man aren't abating in California's capital city after an

 City of London's top policeman warns Brexit will leave Britain 'on the back 
 seats' of intelligence sharing
summary: 
text1:  
 City of London Police Commissioner Ian Dyson said Brexit could diminish UK 
 policing capabilities.  
  He warned that taking a more distant role in 
 Europol would affect intelligence sharing.  
  He said the agency has helped 
 London's police combat terrorism, fraud, and money laundering.  
 
 
  The 
 head of the City of London's police force has warned that Britain's departure 
 from the EU will leave it "on the back seats" on intelligence-sharing arrangements. 
 
 Ian Dyson, the Commissioner of City of London Police, said the UK's impending 
 exit from the Europol joint policing agency could affect his ability to 
 apprehend criminals overseas. 
 The warning is especially acute for policing 
 London's Square Mile financial district, which is a target for large-scale 
 economic crimes by organisations with an international presence. 
 In response 
 to a question from Business Insider at a media briefing this week, Dyson 
 described how an exit from Europol would detract from the "richness" of 
 intelligence available to his officers. 
 Europol a "very impressive intelligence 
 outfit" 
 He said: "Europol is, I think, a very impressive intelligence 
 outfit, it feeds intelligence in from a whole host of agencies, not just 
 policing, across Europe, and it does add to the richness of the information." 
 
 He said Europol information has helped his officers in the past who were 
 investigating terrorism, money laundering, and fraud. 
   
 Dyson continued: 
 "Europol is a European institution, so we cannot be a member of it if we're 
 going to leave the EU. At the moment, a significant chunk of the intelligence 
 that goes into Europol comes from the UK. 
 "We are sitting around the table 
 in terms of how we prioritise, how we shape these organisations' response. 
 We leave Europe, we will be on the back seats. 
 "Other countries sit on 
 the back seats, but I'm not quite sure what that means for me as an operation 
 head in terms of my ability to operate across Europe." 
 Police in countries 
 like Turkey and the United States are partner agencies with Europol, but 
 not full members. 
 At one point,  the UK had hoped to remain a full member, 
  but last November the EU said in no uncertain terms that British would 
 have to leave, a position the UK appears to have accepted. 
 Dyson also 
 said the potential loss of the European Arrest Warrant, which allows EU 
 forces to ask each other to arrest suspects in their jurisdictions, would 
 be a blow. 
 However,  in a recent speech  Theresa May said that the arrest 
 warrant, and close ties to Europol, will be priorities in the Brexit negotiations, 
 and that a lapse in the agreements is something neither the EU and UK "cannot 
 let... happen."   Join the conversation about this story &#187;

 Mothers by Chris Power review ? a daring debut short story collection
summary: 
text1:  
 A compelling examination of alienation, absurdity and the things that are 
 left unsaid  Chris Power?s insightful and intellectually nimble column  
 A Brief Survey of the Short Story  has appeared on the Guardian website 
 since 2007. To produce one?s own short story collection, after a decade 
 spent in critical engagement with writers such as  Vladimir Nabokov ,  Angela 
 Carter ,  John Cheever  and Elizabeth Taylor is a brave and potentially 
 exposing move. Having examined in forensic detail the strengths and weaknesses, 
 the foibles and failures and moments of genius of so many practitioners 
 of the short form, what happens when you turn your hand to it yourself? 
  The 10 stories that make up  Mothers  resist superficial analysis in a 
 way that is interesting in itself. Power is an extraordinarily unshowy craftsman, 
 so that discussing the writing itself feels like trying to focus on the 
 glass of a window, rather than the view beyond. This is partly a function 
 of the transparency of the prose, which so lacks ornament as to almost feel 
 bald in places, and partly to do with the disposition of his narrators, 
 all of whom share a kind of emotional reserve that is close to affectlessness. 
 The risk in this kind of writing is that it leaves the reader unmoved; the 
 reward is that it can more closely mirror daily life, which plays out without 
 a string section or a set of filters to indicate or intensify the mood.

 Martin Luther King anniversary: the US Civil Rights Trail
summary: 
text1:  
 Half a century on from the assassination of Martin Luther King, novelist 
 Dolen Perkins-Valdez takes a moving trip on the newly opened trail, from 
 the great man?s birthplace to the site of his death in Memphis  If you want 
 to understand America, you must do the US Civil Rights Trail. A deep journey 
 through the conscience of a nation, the sites commemorating the 1950s and 
 1960s Civil Rights movement reveal a country trying to reconcile its founding 
 principles with its racial inequities. This period marked the most significant 
 division the nation had faced since its civil war. Throughout the trip, 
 I kept asking myself: what would I do for freedom? There is no way to come 
 away from the Trail without feeling transformed. The trip is equal parts 
 history and inspiration.  The US Civil Rights Trail is a visionary idea: 
 it connects the 110 sites and museums ? mostly across the south, but stretching 
 from Kansas in the Midwest to Delaware in New England ? into a coherent 
 map of a nation?s struggle and triumph. It opened officially in January 
 this year, so in honour of next week?s 50th anniversary of the assassination 
 of Martin Luther King Jr (4 April 1968), over five days I travel the 700-mile 
 segment from his birthplace in  Atlanta  to the place he died in Memphis.

 National minimum wage rise still fails to cover living costs, study shows
summary: 
text1:  
 Extra six weeks? work would be required to cover basic expenses, says Living 
 Wage Foundation  Workers on the national minimum wage would still need to 
 work for an extra six weeks just to cover their everyday living costs, despite 
 an inflation-beating pay rise from this weekend, according to analysis. 
   More than 2 million workers are to receive a pay rise of at least 4.4% 
 from Sunday, as the government?s national living wage increases to £7.83 
 per hour from £7.50 for over-25s. The increase amounts to more than £600 
 per year for full-time workers on basic pay.    Continue reading...

 Playing with my daughter, I noticed my fingers were numb. Then came the memory 
 loss and clumsiness. I thought it was just age, but the doctor had bad news... 
  One January morning in 2014, I lurched upright in bed at about 6am and 
 announced: ?I think I?m having a heart attack.? The main audience for this 
 was my five-month-old daughter, Leon, sharing the bed with us, often sleeping 
 sideways and leaving little snow angels in the sheets. Next to her was my 
 wife Sarah, squashed up against the wooden bars of an open-sided cot we?d 
 clamped on to the bed. Leon was not fazed. She sucked her thumb, waiting 
 to see what happened next. Sarah, more used to my cheery opening remarks, 
 propped herself up on her elbows and squinted.  ?Pain in your arm?? she 
 asked.   Continue reading...

 The recipe for Oprah?s famous sexy breakfast turns out to be more trouble 
 than it?s worth. And what on Earth is truffle zest?  I am not, by instinct, 
 a morning person. Although I can, with a deadline looming and the threat 
 of redundancy hanging over me, manage to get up before 10am. I can wake 
 up only in increments ? it takes me a good hour or so before I can manage 
 anything as complex as eating, and even then, it has to be very simple: 
 toast, perhaps, or an innocuous cereal.  So I was immediately suspicious 
 of Oprah?s famous ?sexy breakfast? recipe because, as far as I?m concerned, 
 the only sexy breakfast is a) prepared by someone else and b) happens after 
 10am.   Continue reading...

 9 over-the-top, macho Putin stunts that were nowhere near as impressive as 
 they seemed
summary: 
text1:  
 RT/YouTube    
 Vladimir Putin is keen to portray himself as a patriotic 
 strongman who will lead Russia to greatness on the world stage. To achieve 
 this, he's taken part in various over-the-top, macho photo ops, many of 
 which are reportedly his idea. 
 Putin hopes these images, cultivated since 
 he became president in 1999, will "create connections" with his constituents 
 in Russia,  said Fiona Hill, who wrote a biography of the Russian president 
 . 
 However, many of them don't really stand up to scrutiny &mdash; scroll 
 down to see what they are.  Kicking ass in judo... against people who hardly 
 fight back.

 Even though Putin has a judo black belt, there's 
 no evidence that he's been publicly challenged by a decent opponent. 
 Benjamin 
 Wittes, an editor at Lawfare blog and judo enthusiast,  called the Russian 
 president  a "fraud martial artist" who "only fights people who are in his 
 power."  
   "Discovering" fragments of two ancient Greek urns under the 
 Black Sea ? which his spokesman later admitted were planted.

 Druginyn/RIA Novosti/Pool/Reuters 
  Putin found the artefacts in the six-feet-deep, 
 clear water and announced "the boys and I found them,"  according to The 
 Guardian . Journalists proceeded to ridicule the photo op. 
 Two months 
 later, his spokesman&nbsp;Dmitry Peskov admitted on the Dozhd TV channel: 
 
 "Of course they were found in the course of an expedition several weeks 
 or days earlier. Of course they were left there or placed there. It's completely 
 normal. 
 "There's no reason to gloat about this and everything else."  
 
   Showing off his soccer skills with FIFA President Gianni Infantino at 
 the Kremlin... with the help of some careful editing. 
   
 Notice how the 
 video cuts out before Putin receives the ball, and crops in close so you 
 can't see what's just happened. Infantino's skills are clear, but Putin's 
 rather less so. 
 The video was part of a PR push to promot the 2018 soccer 
 World Cup, which is being held in Russia.  Russian embassies have started 
 displaying soccer in prominent places too.

 They have taken Mickey Callaway?s mission statement to heart: Be accountable.

 clearly has gotten through to his best player in Yoenis Cespedes, and that 
 is his greatest triumph so...

 boys, eating chocolate, watching telly, and it is no exaggeration to say 
 that I am having the time of my life. For the first time in eight and a

 I would envision myself holding that Oscar above my head. The real success 
 stories are the people who truly believe they are going to be famous, so 
 they mentally prepare. And that?s what I was doing my entire life: preparing 
 for it.?  What Gooding hadn?t thought about was what to do next. That night 
 in 1997, he won best supporting actor for his portrayal of footballer Rod 
 Tidwell in Tom Cruise sports drama  Jerry Maguire . It was the high point 
 of his career, and his performance was so  unforgettably dynamic  that Tidwell?s 
  ?Show me the money!?  catchphrase became part of the language. When Gooding 
 went to pick up the Oscar, it was as if he was still in character. He backflipped 
 and shouted, ?I love you!? to his family, God, Tom Cruise and anyone else 
 he could think of. When the background music swelled, rather than cutting 
 him off, it soundtracked a crescendo of gratitude that was both manic and 
 sincere. Both on screen and off, Gooding?s energy shook up the place. The 
 audience gave him a standing ovation.   Continue reading...

 There is understandable concern about being on the wrong side of history. 
 But I?ll tell you what has never put anyone on the right side of history: 
 shouting women down  By a man-sized margin, my favourite recent news story 
 is the one about two feminists who went to a men-only swimming session in 
 Dulwich, south London, because,  as they explained , they now self-identify 
 as men. An elderly gentleman was initially confused. ?I told him I was a 
 man and he said, ?Oh really??? one woman later told reporters. ?It was a 
 very British response.? Other men at the pool were less sanguine, and complained 
 to reception.  This protest was announced on Mumsnet, a pleasing hotbed 
 of radical feminism these days, as part of a campaign against  proposed 
 changes to the Gender Recognition Act . Currently, anyone who wants to change 
 gender needs to have lived in their chosen gender for two years and been 
 diagnosed with gender dysphoria. If the changes go through, anyone will 
 be able to declare they are a man or woman, regardless of whether they have 
 made any actual changes to their lifestyle or body. This is known as ?self-identification? 
 and the reactions have borne out that Margaret Atwood line, ?Men are afraid 
 women will laugh at them while women are afraid men will kill them.? Men 
 have largely ignored the issue, until it comes charging into their changing 
 room, while  a lot of women have argued  that predatory men could now come 
 into female-only spaces unchallenged.   Continue reading...

 How 1960s cinema gave us a glimpse of our future lives | Ian Jack
summary: 
text1:  
 A new season at the BFI showcases a Britain casting off the moorings of tradition 
 yet uncertain where it was headed  All human history, you might say, is 
 the story of people not knowing what lies around the corner. The typical 
 family snapshot catches the pathos of this ignorance very well: the 12-year-old 
 schoolboy smiling on a seaside promenade in 1935 is unaware of  his fate 
 on a North Atlantic convoy  six years later. But the art form that makes 
 us most aware of this is the cinema. You enter a darkened hall to watch 
 an entertainment you first saw 30, 40, 50 and more years ago. The  story, 
 the scenery and the characters haven?t changed a jot  ? they are as vivacious 
 and pleasurable to watch, as ?real?, as they ever were. But many, if not 
 all, of the actors are dead. The world beyond the screen has moved on unpredictably. 
 The film forces the audience, or at least those in it who are old enough, 
 to remember who they were and how things were when they first saw it.

 in for years?   BJ Watling and Colin de Grandhomme, the Little and Large 
 of Kiwi cricket, mounted a fine recovery on the second day at the Hagley 
 Oval just when England sensed that everything was falling into place after 
 the most frustrating of winters.   After the removal of Kane Williamson 
 10 minutes after lunch, New Zealand were 36 for five  in response to England?s 
 307 . Stuart Broad, having used that new Kookaburra so effectively ? how 
 dare anyone suggest removing it from his grasp? ? had taken three wickets 
 in his opening spell, while Jimmy Anderson had snaffled the other two. An 
 end to England?s dismal run overseas was on the horizon.    Continue reading...

 South Africa 344-6 (Bavuma 26, de Kock 24)  After a lengthy delay Paine 
 has his gloves back on, Hazlewood has the ball in his hands, and de Kock 
 has the seven best runs of the day, four from a textbook straight drive 
 and three more from a calmly placed cover drive. Bavuma has no such fluency 
 and is almost caught on the crease by one that nips back and catches him 
 near his unmentionables. Without intending to be heightist, replays show 
 that was only a couple of inches away from an LBW dismissal.  David Griffiths 
 wonders on email if ?Smith is the better actor?? which I think is an extremely 
 harsh reading of the past few days. Smith?s distress and remorse seems incontrovertible 
 to me. Yes, he made a mistake. Yes, he deserves to be punished. But aside 
 from a horrible error of judgement there?s nothing to suggest he?s as mendacious 
 as some people are making him out to be.     9.48am  BST     While Paine

 Arsenal not prepared to break the bank to keep Jack Wilshere on new contract

 ? Midfielder may reject £80,000-a-week, ?take-it-or-leave-it? offer  ? Club 
 sanguine about chances of player leaving in summer  Arsenal fear Jack Wilshere 
 will reject their offer of a new contract and leave on a free transfer in 
 the summer. Arsène Wenger has previously suggested the club have made him 
 a take-it-or-leave-it offer and, at the moment, it looks as though the midfielder 
 will do the latter. Everton, West Ham and Juventus have been linked with 
 a move for the 26-year-old.  Arsenal have proposed a heavily incentivised 
 deal because they are mindful of Wilshere?s terrible fitness record. He 
 pulled out of Gareth Southgate?s England squad during the recent international 
 break with a knee problem but the player has trained and is in contention 
 to face Stoke at Emirates Stadium on Sunday.   Continue reading...

 ? Manager upbeat before key Champions League ties and derby  ? Victory at 
 Crystal Palace would strengthen grip on top-four place  Jürgen Klopp has 
 said Liverpool are well-equipped and well-prepared for the series of ?finals? 
 that will define their season.  The Liverpool manager takes charge of his 
 100th Premier League game on Saturday at Crystal Palace where victory, coupled 
 with a Tottenham win over Chelsea on Sunday, would establish a 10-point 
 lead over the champions in the race for a Champions League place. Liverpool 
 then face Manchester City in a Champions League quarter-final, either side 
 of a Merseyside derby, and Klopp has called on his team to approach every 
 game with an all-or-nothing mentality.   Continue reading...

 Thomas Paine by JCD Clark review ? a High Tory on the radical hero
summary: 
text1:  
 The veteran enfant terrible of English historians sets out to rescue the 
 author of Common Sense from ?from the enormous approbation of posterity? 
  JCD Clark is the veteran enfant terrible of English historical writing; 
 now in his mid-60s, but still all petted lip, provocation and attention-seeking. 
 A High Tory, Anglo-Catholic Little Englander, he has spent his career assaulting 
 the central categories of the Whig-Liberal and Marxist versions of the English 
 past. Clark identifies several moments of putrefaction in English history, 
 such as  EEC membership in 1973  and the  Great Reform Act of 1832 .  His 
 Tory traditionalism reaches back further even than that of  Jacob Rees-Mogg 
 , the so-called ?Honourable Member for the 18th Century?; for Clark thinks 
 the rot set in earlier still, during the late 17th century, at the not-so-Glorious 
 Revolution of 1688, when the country unforgivably abandoned the divine right 
 of kings for the curdled compromises of parliamentary monarchy. Unsurprisingly, 
 Clark has accumulated a few enemies among historians, and he is extraordinarily 
 lucky that his latest book has fallen into the hands of such an indulgent 
 reviewer.   Continue reading...

 The secret to? avoiding the same old arguments with your partner
summary: 
text1:  
 Rather than focusing on what annoys you, make a big deal out of it when your 
 partner does something positive   Focus on what is working.  If you are 
 keen to exit a cycle of negativity, create a list of the lovely things your 
 partner does, no matter how small, that you can be thankful for. Rather 
 than focusing on what annoys you, elevate the small details of your partner?s 
 thoughtfulness. Better still, make a big deal out of it when your partner 
 does something positive. It will motivate them towards acts of kindness. 
   Be vulnerable.  Often a criticism holds a veiled wish. When&nbsp;you say, 
 ?You?re always at football with your friends,? what you may mean is, ?I 
 wish you were with me.? Try asking for what you want and sitting with the 
 possibility that you won?t get it.   Continue reading...

 It?s very much all about you and what you?re not getting, says Annalisa Barbieri. 
 But she seems to have the power and it might be that when you?re about to 
 leave that she listens   My wife and I are both in our early 50s. I love 
 her, find her attractive and like her as a person, but we have a fundamental 
 difficulty: we can?t talk about any kind of problem or anything personal. 
 Or, rather,  she  can?t. If things are going well, we get on OK, but if 
 there is a problem we just argue. There is no meeting of minds, no talking 
 through something. So either nothing gets said or we have big, horrible 
 arguments.     The hardest part for me is regarding sex. We can?t talk about 
 this at all. I feel that we don?t have a sexual relationship. Every three 
 weeks or so we might have sex, but I am always frustrated by it. This started 
 12 years ago. When we do have sex, it is always the same and she always 
 initiates it because if I do she just won?t respond. When I started to become 
 tempted to look elsewhere I resolved to do all I could to try to improve 
 things.     Continue reading...

 As the price of pods has soared so has violence ? and forest defenders are 
 increasingly risking their lives to protect precious wildlife habitat from 
 being felled for profit   The vanilla thieves of Anjahana were so confident 
 of their power to intimidate farmers they provided advance warning of raids. 
 ?We are coming tonight,? they would write in a note pushed under doors in 
 this remote coastal village in Madagascar. ?Prepare what we want.?  But 
 they either undervalued their target commodity or overestimated the meekness 
 of their victims. After one assault too many at the turn of the year, a 
 crowd rounded up five alleged gangsters, dragged them into the village square 
 and then set about the bloody task of mob justice.   Continue reading...

title:   
 Immigrants Give America a Foreign-Policy Advantage
summary: History proves they can help the U.S. keep other countries in check.
text1:  
 It has often been thought that the composition of the American public, consisting 
 as it does of immigrants from so many lands, is a vulnerability in foreign 
 policy?that, for example, German immigrants would harbor affinities for 
 their land of origin and become disloyal during the world wars. The argument 
 was taken to a shameful extreme with the internment of Japanese Americans 
 after Pearl Harbor. What has received less attention is the extent to which 
 America?s immigrant fabric can be a foreign-policy advantage, even a threat 
 to other countries. That is what British Prime Minister Palmerston feared, 
 and what President Lincoln stoked, to forestall British recognition of the 
 Confederacy during the Civil War. The result was an important inhibition 
 on Great Britain, then the most powerful state of the international order. 
  The subject has particular resonance now, when the President of the United 
 States overtly considers immigrants a security threat, seeking to ban immigrants 
 from Muslim countries, dramatically restricting the numbers of refugees 
 admitted from war-torn countries, and arguing for money to be diverted from 
 the Pentagon budget to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border,  claiming 
  ?enemy combatants [are] pouring into our country.? This pinched view of 
 immigrant communities solely as a risk fails to capitalize on one of our 
 country?s signal advantages. At the moment of our country?s greatest vulnerability, 
 during the early years of the American Civil War, immigrants in the United 
 States actually held back foreign interference?and thereby helped make America 
 the strongest country in the world.  As America became economically and 
 politically stronger in the 19th century, other countries had opportunities 
 to impede its rise. From 1861 to 1865 the United States was profoundly vulnerable 
 to meddling from outside powers as the Union fought secession by the Southern 
 states. The period from 1861 to 1863 was especially propitious for intervention, 
 since Union armies were losing most engagements, and the North had not yet 
 embraced slavery?s abolition or become the industrial juggernaut it would 
 as a consequence of the war effort.  The British government clearly saw 
 the possibilities of working against the United States in its time of crisis. 
 In 1860 Britain was unquestionably the strongest state in the world, holding 
 68 percent of the wealthiest continent?s riches and a dominant military. 
 Britain had not only the means but also the motive to interfere. Prime Minister 
 Palmerston noted that ?if the North and South are definitively disunited 
 and ? at the same time Mexico could be turned into a prosperous monarchy, 
 I do not know any arrangement that would be more advantageous to us.?  In 
 1861 Britain?s rulers had considerable discomfort with America as a revolutionary 
 power. This was not because America was at that time exporting its revolution, 
 but simply because of the ideology America represented: It was the rabble 
 of every other country empowered by the franchise. Americans broadly understood 
 and celebrated themselves in the same terms. As  The New York Times  crowed 
 in 1862, ?our friends?that there could be no grander tribute paid to the 
 genius of the republic?are the dumb masses.?  British attitudes toward America 
 cleaved along class lines. As described by the U.S. minister to Britain, 
 Charles Francis Adams, ?the great body of the aristocracy and the commercial 
 classes are anxious to see the United States go to pieces. The middle and 
 lower classes sympathize with us.?  Palmerston exemplified this disdain 
 for America in all its political, economic, and cultural dimensions. He 
 ruminated with satisfaction in 1855 that ?a British force landed in the 
 Southern part of the Union, proclaiming freedom to the blacks would shake 
 many of the stars from their banner.?  On the eve of the American Civil 
 War, there was in Britain a general sense of America as an emerging rival 
 and concern about retaining Britain?s advantages over it. British reformer 
 Richard Cobden estimated that three-fourths of the British House of Commons 
 would vote in favor of actions by Britain to ?dismember? the United States. 
  The confluence of British interests in favor of recognizing the Confederacy 
 was strong: appreciation by elites of the threat a rising America posed 
 for Britain, politically and economically; economic complementarity of cotton-producing 
 Southern plantations with British industry; direct competition from Northern 
 industries with British manufacturers and traders; a cultural attraction 
 to the South on the part of British aristocrats; virulent anti-Americanism 
 on the part of key political actors, as well as a broad cultural anti-Americanism 
 among elites; and the savory delight of watching the United States rend 
 itself asunder, with the Southern states making the same arguments against 
 the North that Britain?s North American colonies used in breaking from the 
 British Empire.  In 1861, Palmerston assured Queen Victoria that ?Great 
 Britain is in a better state than at any former time to inflict a severe 
 blow upon and to read a lesson to the United States which will not soon 
 be forgotten.?  It would not have taken much in the early years of the American 
 Civil War for Britain to tip the balance toward Confederate victory, either. 
 Several options were available that incurred little risk of pulling Britain 
 into the war or damaging Britain?s strategic interests. Extending diplomatic 
 recognition might have by itself been enough to definitively disunite America. 
 The Union even gave the British government several legitimating opportunities 
 in the way it crafted the terms of blockading Southern ports against international 
 commerce or provoked a crisis by boarding the British ship  Trent , and 
 taking Southern emissaries prisoner in 1861.  Yet Britain largely stayed 
 out of the Civil War, declining to administer that devastating blow to American 
 power and potential. The British government resisted not because it was 
 intimidated by Union threats of war in retaliation, feared putting Canada 
 at risk, thought the South would lose the war, was concerned with higher-priority 
 foreign-policy problems, or could not?this early in the war?countenance 
 aligning itself with a slaveholding Confederacy given abolitionist sentiment 
 within Britain.  Because of its British immigrants, the U.S. was uniquely 
 able to affect domestic politics within Britain. Historian Ephraim Douglass 
 Adams posits that ?the great crisis in America was almost equally a crisis 
 in the domestic history of Great Britain itself.? Aligning Britain with 
 the Confederacy risked aggravating two worrisome issues for the British 
 government domestically: disaffection among urban workers still without 
 political representation in Britain, and the deepening hostility of Scots 
 and Irish living under British control. The British government worried that 
 if they intervened, they would have a more difficult time controlling Ireland 
 and Scotland. The majority of immigrants from Britain were to the North, 
 and family ties to their homeland would further embitter Scots and Irish 
 against British rule if Britain sided with the South.    America was unique 
 as a foreign-policy problem because choices about it could resonate back 
 to Britain?s own politics. In 1861 democratization in Britain had not much 
 progressed from the 1832 reforms that expanded the franchise to only 20 
 percent of the men in Britain. The government feared stoking resentment 
 among residents of major urban centers, since property requirements still 
 prevented them voting?only one in 24 Britons were enfranchised. Industrial 
 workers, the newly urbanized and economically productive lower classes, 
 were not among them.  The affinities of this newly urbanized industrial 
 workforce in Britain had a cultural attraction to the dynamic, opportunity, 
 and political enfranchisement of an industrializing American North. Attitudes 
 were mixed early in the war, but they solidified after canny encouragement 
 from the Lincoln administration, which sent ships of food for relief of 
 unemployed British workers. President Lincoln also wrote to workers? organizations 
 encouraging common cause. As a result, even textile workers in Manchester?those 
 most economically affected by the embargo?were staunchly opposed to the 
 Confederacy by 1864. Lincoln?s fostering of that sentiment capitalized on 
 Palmerston?s fear that his foreign-policy choices regarding intervention 
 would reverberate back inside Britain.  Palmerston considered affiliation 
 of an aristocratic British ruling class with a plantation protoaristocracy 
 in the American South to risk imperiling his ability to prevail in Britain?s 
 own domestic debate about political participation?a deligitimization by 
 association. Acting against the Union required weighing foreign-policy advantage 
 against the risk of domestic damage, a calculation that America?because 
 of its more participatory form of government?was uniquely able to impose. 
  The American government posed the threat of domestic insurrection in a 
 second way, as well: secession by Ireland and Scotland. U.S. Secretary of 
 State William Seward?s ?spread-eagle nationalism,? which brandished American 
 power, was unrestrained in seeking ways to inflate the cost to Britain of 
 intervening. U.S. minister to Britain Adams characterized the American war 
 as an internal insurrection, something Britain itself was concerned with 
 because of the possibility for parallels with British subjugation of Ireland, 
 Scotland, and Wales. At the height of tensions between the two nations, 
 an American diplomatic envoy ominously challenged, ?Is England so secure 
 in the future against home revolt or foreign ambition as to venture, now 
 in our need, to plant the seeds of revenge??  Kevin Phillips estimates that 
 by 1860, 90 percent of migration from England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales 
 was to the American North. This represented a significant shift from the 
 earlier immigration flow to the culturally more familiar South. While many 
 states harbored political and religious exiles, America?s policy of citizenship 
 and broad political representation gave British emigres direct influence 
 in government policies far beyond what was possible in any other country. 
 Palmerston was concerned about the effect of ?the exiled Irishmen? making 
 impossible cooperation between Britain and the United States. Immigration 
 patterns created a strong affiliation by family as well as ideology between 
 Britain?s working class and the industrial American North.  Irish Catholics 
 were more sympathetic to the Southern cause, but large numbers of them also 
 served in the Union Army, often comprising whole units. (One reason for 
 hostility to the North was the high casualty rate those Irish units suffered.) 
 English, Welsh, and Scottish immigrants were staunch Union backers, like 
 their German counterparts. All of these communities might become conveyor 
 belts of insurrection back to home countries?if the United States were able 
 to ?weaponize? them.  Ultimately, the Palmerston government remained neutral 
 throughout the American Civil War because of the way Americans of British 
 origin could affect domestic politics in Britain. Those immigrants had political 
 rights their British relatives envied and were agitating to attain for themselves 
 via the franchise in England, and in hopes for self-determination in Scotland 
 and Ireland. Being an immigrant society could well be credited with saving 
 the nation by forestalling British support to the Confederacy.  During the 
 most dangerous time in American history, its values served to constrain 
 the choices of its international adversaries by using the aspirations of 
 their own citizens against them. The political liberties and economic opportunities 
 afforded European immigrants in the United States turned out to be a powerful 
 and unique foreign-policy advantage: Who the United States was as a domestic 
 political culture effectively limited the foreign-policy choices of the 
 hegemon of the international order.       This article has been adapted 
 from Kori Schake?s new book,  Safe Passage.

 1996?s Secrets) and the 11-week US No 1 reign of windswept mega-ballad Un-Break

 No, the story that sticks in her head is a little less glitzy. One night, 
 she tells me over the phone from New York, she was followed to a restaurant 
 toilet by a group of female fans who, while she was having a quick sit down, 
 tapped on the cubicle wall. ?Excuse me, are you Toni Braxton?? they asked. 
 ?Can we get your autograph?? ?I was like: ?Can you give me a second?!?? 
 Braxton laughs, her low, husky voice lending the story unwarranted gravitas.

title:   
 Civilisations by David Olusoga review ? a riposte to European superiority
summary: 
text1:  
 A subversive response to Kenneth Clark?s series deconstructs the notion of 
 civilisation and charts the effects of greed, hubris and disease  In the 
 summer of 1520, towards the end of his life, the great German artist  Albrecht 
 Dürer  travelled from his home in Nuremberg to the Low Countries, to meet 
 his new patron, the Holy Roman emperor Charles V. At the same time, halfway 
 across the world in the middle of the Americas, the Spanish adventurer  
 Hernán Cortés  was carrying out his merciless siege of the Aztec capital, 
 Tenochtitlán. By the time it fell, on 13 August 1521, much of the city lay 
 in ruins, and as many as 100,000 of its inhabitants had already died. Many 
 more were massacred as the victors set about plundering whatever they could 
 lay their hands on. When the first shipment of spoils arrived in Brussels, 
 Dürer was one of those who flocked to examine it. He was blown away. ?All 
 the days of my life,? he wrote in his diary, ?I have seen nothing that rejoiced 
 my heart so much as these things, for I saw amongst them wonderful works 
 of art, and I marvelled at the subtle ingenuity of men in foreign lands. 
 Indeed I cannot express all that I thought there.?  This vignette of cross-global 
 inspiration is one of the highlights of  David Olusoga ?s new book, a richly 
 illustrated companion volume to the two episodes he is presenting in the 
  BBC?s new  Civilisations  . In outline, its format is fairly Eurocentric 
 and conventional. Despite all the fuss that has been made about the TV project?s 
 updating of  Kenneth Clark?s 1969 series  Civilisation  , Olusoga?s own 
 approach is framed in terms that would hardly have shocked audiences 50 
 years ago: the first half of the book considers contact between civilisations 
 in ?the European Age of Discovery? (from the 15th to the 18th centuries), 
 while the second looks at the impact of industrialisation on the art and 
 artists of the 19th century.   Continue reading...

 Why are the poor blamed and shamed for their deaths?
summary: 
text1:  
 When someone dies, she often suffers a brutal moral autopsy, says Barbara 
 Ehrenreich. Did she smoke? Drink excessively? Eat too much fat?  I watched 
 in dismay as most of my educated, middle-class friends began, at the onset 
 of middle age, to obsess about their health and likely longevity. Even those 
 who were at one point determined to change the world refocused on changing 
 their bodies. They undertook exercise or yoga regimens; they filled their 
 calendars with medical tests and exams; they boasted about their ?good? 
 and ?bad? cholesterol counts, their heart rates and blood pressure.  Mostly 
 they understood the task of ageing to be self-denial, especially in the 
 realm of diet, where one medical fad, one study or another, condemned fat 
 and meat, carbs, gluten, dairy or all animal-derived products. In the health-conscious 
 mindset that has prevailed among the world?s affluent people for about four 
 decades now, health is indistinguishable from virtue, tasty foods are ?sinfully 
 delicious?, while healthful foods may taste good enough to be advertised 
 as ?guilt-free?. Those seeking to compensate for a lapse undertake punitive 
 measures such as hours-long cardio sessions, fasts, purges or diets composed 
 of different juices carefully sequenced throughout the day.   Continue reading...

 'The Ball Is Very Much in the Russian Court'
summary: Avoiding another Cold War may require Moscow to change course.
text1:  
 On Thursday, it was Americans who learned they were being kicked out of Russia. 
 On Friday, it was Europeans. Russia?s Foreign Ministry  summoned the ambassadors 
  of several European nations and ordered the expulsion of their diplomats; 
 their number precisely mirrored the number of Russian diplomats expelled 
 by Western nations on Monday. In all, 28 nations expelled 153 Russians over 
 the past week in response to Moscow?s alleged role in the  attempted assassination 
  by nerve agent of Sergei Skripal, a former Russian spy, and his daughter, 
 Yulia, in the U.K. The U.S. expelled by far the highest number of Russians, 
 60, and Moscow responded in kind. The U.K. expelled 23 and faced similar 
 retaliation.  But on Friday, Moscow went one step further: It ordered a 
 reduction in the size of the British diplomatic mission in Russia to match 
 the numbers in Russia?s mission to the U.K. It did not say what those numbers 
 were.  Relations between Russia and the West are the ?worst that we?ve seen 
 since the Cold War, potentially worse than some periods of the Cold War,? 
 Alina Polyakova, a fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said. 
  Polyakova said that during the Cold War years, there were avenues of dialogue 
 between the Soviet Union and the U.S., including military-to-military relations 
 and ?a certain set of rules that both sides knew to follow.?  ?Now those 
 kinds of rules aren?t so clear anymore. We don?t have the same kind of institutional 
 structure for a bipolar world,? she said. ?And for those reason, it?s difficult 
 to see where this downward spiral ends.?    Until Friday, Russia?s response 
 to the expulsions of its diplomats was a precise tit-for-tat, suggesting 
 that Moscow, which denies it had a role in the assassination attempt against 
 the Skripals, didn?t want to make the situation deteriorate further by one-upping 
 other countries? reprisals. But the Russian Foreign Ministry?s order of 
 the reduction in the size of the British diplomatic mission suggests there 
 may be more actions ahead?unless the U.K. decides to accept the decision 
 and not respond in a commensurate manner.  Moscow acted similarly last fall 
 when it ordered the U.S. to reduce its diplomatic staff in the country by 
 755 people to match the number of Russian staff in the U.S. That move was 
 a response to the Obama administration?s decision in December 2016 to expel 
 30 Russian diplomats from the U.S. and seize Russian diplomatic compounds 
 in New York and Maryland?a move that came in response to Moscow?s interference 
 in the U.S. presidential election.  ?I don?t think this is a decision that 
 the United States is taking lightly,? Nina Jankowicz, a global fellow at 
 the Wilson Center, told me about the most recent round of expulsions. ?I 
 don?t think that they want to continue to do this. But Russia leaves us 
 no choice with its behavior.?  Tensions between the two sides predate both 
 the assassination attempt against the Skripals and the U.S. presidential 
 election. They began after Russia?s annexation in 2013 of Ukraine?s Crimea 
 region. Western nations imposed sanctions against Russia for its actions, 
 which continue as it supports a breakaway region in Ukraine. The two sides 
 are also at odds over the future of Syria where Moscow backs Bashar al-Assad; 
 the future of the Iranian nuclear deal, which Russia, a signatory, supports 
 (European countries do, too; the Trump administration has signaled it may 
 withdraw from the deal); and other global conflicts. Indeed it is conflicts 
 such as these that may be major sites of future tensions between the U.S. 
 and Russia. Last month in Syria, for example,  U.S. forces killed about 
 200 Russian mercenaries  fighting on Assad?s behalf in Syria.  ?More of 
 this is going to continue to happen because the avenues of communication 
 are not as good as they may have been during the Cold War period for deconfliction,? 
 Polyakova told me.  There is another difference between the Cold War period 
 and today, Jankowicz said: the differing nature of the administrations in 
 Washington.  ?In the Reagan administration, it was clear from every single 
 official?from a random official at the State Department on up to President 
 Reagan himself? where the Reagan administration stood on Russia. And to 
 me it?s not really clear where the Trump administration stands.? She cited 
 President Trump?s failure to publicly criticize Russian President Vladimir 
 Putin, Trump?s  assertion  last November that Russia ?can greatly help? 
 on a host of issues from North Korea to Ukraine, and his  reported  resistance 
 to selling arms to Ukraine. ?There?s just such an incongruity in the decisions 
 his administration is making and what the president says or does not say,? 
 she said. ?His silence to me is deafening?and that?s the difference between 
 Reagan-era Cold War policies and what we?re seeing today.?  Ultimately, 
 though, the tensions are unlikely to wane unless Russia changes course. 
 The alleged use of a nerve agent in the U.K. is  only the latest  in a series 
 of such alleged actions in the U.K. by Russia?actions that previously have 
 mostly been met with silence from Western capitals.  ?What the Russians 
 have been doing is slowly testing the West, playing on the gray zone of 
 the rules, see what the West will do, and now there?s been a response,? 
 Polyakova said. ?I think the ball is very much in the Russian court to decide: 
 Are we going to continue this confrontation strategy of trying to test the 
 West, or are were going to scale it back??

 The Americanization of an Ancient Faith
summary: The 2,000-year-old Coptic Church is trying something new: spreading its message across the United States?and the rest of the world.
text1:  
 One day in the fall of 2010, Father Anthony Messeh, then a priest at the 
 St. Mark Coptic Orthodox Church in Fairfax, Virginia, sat down with a list 
 of names. There were 30 individuals?all American converts with no Egyptian 
 heritage?who had been baptized at the church since his arrival in 2001. 
 Of the group, only eight were still active members.  ?That just broke my 
 heart,? Messeh told me one afternoon last summer. ?If one or two people 
 had left, then maybe I could say it was something wrong with them. But if 
 22 out of 30 had left, that meant it?s something wrong with me.?  One American 
 couple who?d left the congregation told him that while the church felt like 
 a family, it didn?t feel like  their  family. St. Mark?s, like many of the 
 over 250 Coptic churches in the United States, is overwhelmingly comprised 
 of Copts raised in Egypt or born to Egyptian parents. Of the nearly 6,000 
 members of the church, most still converse comfortably in Arabic, and the 
 services retain Egyptian cultural norms: Men and women tend to sit separately, 
 people move around freely during prayers, and Egyptian food is often served. 
  Americans, even those baptized into the faith, could feel like outsiders?not 
 only at St. Mark?s, but at churches across the country. Recent waves of 
 immigration from Egypt had intensified the influence of Egyptian culture 
 across American congregations.    Messeh would soon become an early advocate 
 for a new kind of Coptic church?one that could appeal to American converts 
 but maintain the core tenets of the nearly 2,000-year-old faith. By 2012, 
 he decided to establish his own congregation. His services, with their chanted 
 prayers, elaborate robes, and cymbal-playing, look traditionally Coptic 
 Orthodox. But the English-language liturgy, crowded rows of ethnically diverse 
 worshippers, and evangelical style of preaching feel rooted in the United 
 States.  Messeh?s church, now 300 members strong, isn?t the only one of 
 its kind: In the past decade, dozens of Americanized Coptic churches have 
 opened across the United States, concentrated in Texas, California, and 
 along the East Coast. In 2015, Bishop Youssef, one of 10 Coptic bishops 
 in the country, founded the American Orthodox Coptic Church of Alexandria, 
 which currently comprises five congregations from Arizona to Florida, and 
 caters specifically to a U.S.-born audience. Church leadership has embraced 
 the governing philosophy these changes represent: If the church wants to 
 grow, it needs to part with some aspects of Egyptian culture and formally 
 embrace its American identity.  But these moves have provoked some anxiety 
 among the laity, who worry that dropping Egyptian culture will undermine 
 the faith. A new conversation has emerged among the faithful: Can an Americanized 
 church truly count as Coptic?  ***  While the Coptic Church doesn?t keep 
 any formal tally on its global presence, many scholars estimate that there 
 are over 500,000 Copts living in the United States, with many tens of thousands 
 others living in other English-speaking countries. There are no formal estimates 
 on converts either. But their growing presence in established churches, 
 as well as their membership in the new ?mission churches? in the United 
 States, is a widely acknowledged phenomenon. ?There are now more and more 
 non-Egyptian people in church, and I am getting to be less and less unique, 
 which is great,? said Rachel Smallwood, a native Texan who was raised a 
 devout Baptist and was baptized into the Coptic Church in Houston in 2012. 
  American converts often first encounter Coptic Orthodoxy through a friend, 
 colleague, or romantic partner. Marriage is a common motivation for conversion, 
 as both partners have to be baptized in the faith in order to be married 
 in the Church. Many American converts are also drawn to the Church?s claims 
 that it?s the oldest in the world, founded by St. Mark the Evangelist in 
 the first century. ?The Protestant circles I was in would say, ?We are trying 
 to be more like Jesus Christ,?? said Toni Svonavec, an elementary-school 
 teacher in Maryland who was baptized in 2014. ?But for me, that is exactly 
 what the Coptic Church already has.?  While most ethnic Orthodox churches 
 cling to linguistic fidelity and cultural continuity abroad, the Coptic 
 Church has not resisted acculturation. Its first English liturgy, the prayers 
 and rituals that govern different church services, was introduced in 1980, 
 just a decade after the first Coptic churches were established in North 
 America. By the 1990s, almost all of the 50-plus churches in the United 
 States prayed mostly in English, a development blessed by the Coptic Pope 
 Shenouda III. Some Egyptian customs?like standing throughout the entire 
 service, or kissing the priest?s hand as a greeting?also began to fade away, 
 and more converts joined.  If this Americanization in the late 20th century 
 had continued organically, Messeh and others may never have felt the need 
 to establish a new brand of church. But over the past decade, a rise in 
 Coptic immigration from Egypt, spurred by increased persecution by radical 
 Islamist groups and the 2011 Egyptian revolution, has drastically changed 
 Church demographics abroad. Sam Tadros, a fellow at the Hudson Institute 
 in Washington, D.C., who writes widely on modern Coptic identity, estimates 
 that over 18 percent of ethnic Copts now live outside of Egypt.  The immigration 
 wave has been a boon to the Church?s population: There are now more Coptic 
 churches in the United States than ever before. But it?s also created a 
 cultural split. Church leaders have found themselves caught between the 
 needs of their longtime members and those of the newcomers. Many English-speaking 
 churches have switched back to Arabic liturgies and reincorporated Egyptian 
 customs.  
These changes risk alienating American converts, and the leaders 
 worry they?re losing American-born Copts, too. ?The last go-around, when 
 my church flipped from English to Arabic, we lost a lot of people who had 
 been raised American,? said Laura Michael of Jacksonville, Florida, who 
 runs a blog called  Coptic Mom and Dad , referring to the church her Egyptian-born 
 parents help start in Virginia in the 1980s. While the all-Arabic service 
 worked for her, she said, the change was much harder on younger relatives. 
  ***  In addition to their popularity among converts, the Americanized churches 
 have been welcomed by second- and third-generation Copts, according to several 
 American-raised Copts I spoke with.    But their purpose isn?t solely keeping 
 Church membership intact?they are also the basis for a new evangelization 
 effort.  As religious minorities in Muslim-ruled Egypt, Copts have historically 
 been prohibited from evangelizing. Gaining converts in countries like the 
 United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia has thus proven particularly 
 exciting. Multiple priests and members emphasized to me that rather than 
 worry about losing their culture in foreign lands, they?re eager to finally 
 start spreading it.  Their effort could be eased by the Church?s embrace 
 of English-language liturgies; typically, a mix of Arabic and Coptic is 
 used during services. Among advocates for the Americanized churches, the 
 change wasn?t seen as a huge leap, as it would be in other Orthodox faiths. 
 (The Armenian Orthodox church forbids English-language services, for example.) 
 The Coptic Church is unique among Orthodox churches in its emphasis on vernacular 
 prayer. It also lacks an emotional connection to Arabic, the most common 
 language of prayer among Egyptian Copts. It?s seen primarily as the language 
 of Islam, and therefore dispensable.  There is some concern over losing 
 the Coptic language in the liturgy?perhaps the most controversial move the 
 new churches have made. But many Copts argue the language isn?t as central 
 to the faith as others say it is. ?It?s nostalgia, these people who pray 
 in Coptic. It has nothing to do with the church or spirituality,? said Father 
 Athanasius Iskander, whose exacting translations of Coptic liturgies and 
 hymns are used throughout the English-speaking world. ?The Bible tells us 
 that worshippers should understand what they say. If the language dies in 
 this land of immigration, then that?s only a natural progression.?  Messeh 
 agrees. ?This is about the Americans finding this faith for the first time, 
 and there being a home for them. That?s all. We need all kinds of churches,? 
 he said. ?But you  can  have a Coptic Church without the Coptic, and I?ll 
 go to my grave saying that.?  With the fresh need to look beyond language 
 or ethnicity as the binding agents of Coptic identity, advocates for Americanized 
 churches often emphasize a connection to historical Coptic persecution. 
  ?When I bring visitors to church, I emphasize the bloodshed and the martyrs,? 
 said Sandra Mathoslah, an advocate for Americanized churches who lives in 
 the Washington, D.C., area. ?That is the bread and butter of the Coptic 
 Church?this perseverance,? she said. ?It?s a church with a lot of suffering.? 
  ?You are a Copt if you relate to that history,? Tadros, from the Hudson 
 Institute, told me. In his view, there are enough people around the world 
 who can relate that there?s potential for a global Church community. He 
 recalled meeting the first ethnic Japanese priest at a church in Cairo a 
 few years ago, and his surprise at hearing Coptic chants recited with a 
 Japanese accent. ?For 2,000 years, we were the official Church of Egypt,? 
 Tadros said. ?Today, we are in Pakistan, Singapore, Thailand, New Zealand, 
 Sweden, Fiji, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Mexico, Brazil, Ghana?we have invaded 
 the world.?  ***  Among some Copts, the Americanized churches are seen as 
 less authentic. There?s a fear ?that if we lose the culture, we lose the 
 faith,? Messeh explained. There have also been charges of elitism, with 
 the Americanized churches attracting wealthier and more highly educated 
 Copts, who are sometimes perceived as looking down on their newly arrived 
 counterparts.  Despite these concerns, or perhaps because of them, some 
 worry the mission churches could break off from Egypt. ?They took it very, 
 very hard, out of their love and commitment to the Coptic Orthodox Church,? 
 Bishop Youssef told me, referring to some congregants? reactions to his 
 2015 announcement of an American branch of the Church. (Coptic bishops are 
 known by their title and first name.) Nonetheless, he assured them that 
 while ?communication with the mother church is very important, our connection 
 with the holy tradition is not with a geographical place.?  For Messeh, 
 such concerns both misunderstand what is essential about the Church?s faith 
 and ignore the benefits of embracing American culture. ?In Egypt there is 
 a lot of emphasis on emotions, on faith by any means, and on miracle stories,? 
 he said. ?But this emotional pull is less intriguing to Americans than the 
 rich intellectual history of the Church, stretching back to Origen and St. 
 Athanasius. As American Orthodox Copts, we have a chance to restore the 
 balance and understand our historical roots. We can take the best of both 
 cultures.?  By many cultural standards, it?s a demanding faith. While priests 
 at Americanized churches might preach in English, post on Twitter, and reference 
 American pop culture, they still oversee a flock with strict obligations: 
 one that prays a three-hour Sunday-morning liturgy, goes to regular confession, 
 fasts completely nine hours before Sunday communion, and keeps to a strict 
 religious calendar that demands a vegan diet for nearly two-thirds of the 
 year.  For many converts, these demands are part of the appeal?offering 
 more concrete ways to express faith?even if they don?t guarantee acceptance 
 within the broader Coptic community. Several converts at Messeh?s church 
 in Washington told me they worried that they wouldn?t be welcomed into a 
 local Coptic church in a new city, as immigrant-dense congregations can 
 appear to view non-Egyptians with suspicion. One student told me that, when 
 traveling, he attends Russian or Greek Orthodox services, as those churches 
 have a longer tradition of interaction with outsiders.    For Bishop Youssef, 
 converts? acceptance of the Orthodox faith and its tenets more than binds 
 them to the Church. ?I don?t like the phrase ?mission churches,?? he said, 
 ?because I think every church should be a mission church.?  Still, even 
 those Copts who embrace Americanization harbor some reservations. Baher 
 Iskander, who moved to the United States from Egypt when he was 12, admits 
 that his primary concern with a developing American Coptic tradition is 
 that the values of the Church in Egypt?a binding sense of obligation to 
 attend services and serve the Church?don?t give way to American notions 
 of personal choice and individualism, leading to more lax attitudes. As 
 someone raised in both the Egyptian Protestant and Coptic Orthodox churches, 
 he is less moved by the need to spread the Orthodox faith.  ?I understand 
 that on a big vision and a macro scale, this is the right thing to do,? 
 he said, referencing the rise of Americanized churches. ?But the Coptic 
 Church is also part of my ethnicity. I love going to my home church in Houston, 
 eating Egyptian food after the service, and have all the aunts kiss me.? 
  Nearly all of the almost 30 Copts I spoke with?priests, deacons, servants, 
 immigrants, converts?were optimistic that the Church will work out its growing 
 pains, and even flourish as an American tradition, much like global Catholicism 
 remains culturally specific but united under the Pope. While the See of 
 Alexandria will remain the final word in matters of faith, the American 
 Coptic church could become its own force in the Coptic tradition.  For Tadros, 
 the most relevant comparison to what?s happening in America might be the 
 Church?s presence in Africa and Latin America, where its history as a pre-colonial 
 church that is indigenously African has made it particularly popular. In 
 those parishes, the acceptance of local customs came quickly, and with little 
 fanfare: ?If we can accept the dancing in Kenyan services and the drums 
 in Bolivia, then why not the mission churches in D.C.?? Tadros asked.  He 
 has?somewhat controversially?predicted that Copts, facing mounting persecution, 
  will eventually leave Egypt . But this prospect does not overwhelm him. 
    ?What is Egypt? A piece of land. The places of Nicea and Chalcedon have 
 no Christians. Are they less blessed?? Tadros asked. ?Maybe God kept the 
 Church alive so that now it can spread across the world.?

 The gender pay gap at the UK's biggest banks, asset managers, and insurers 
 ? from best to worst
summary: 
text1:  
 Reuters    
 LONDON &mdash; New figures show that men earn an almost 60% 
 more than women on average at some of the UK's top financial institutions. 
 
 UK companies with more than 250 employees have been forced to reveal their 
 gender pay gaps under  new rules introduced by the British government . 
 
 Business Insider rounded up all the data that has so far been published 
 by the largest banks, insurers, and asset managers in the UK. It includes 
 international firms like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, which have large operations 
 in Britain. 
 It is, in theory, possible for firms to have a gender pay 
 gap where women earn more than men on average but it is a rarity. Average 
 pay at all firms on this list is higher for men than that for women. 
 Institutions 
 are ranked in ascending order by the size of their mean pay gap between 
 men and women, while median pay gaps are also included. 
  This list will 
 be updated as more firms release their pay stats as the government's April 
 5 deadline approaches.   Bank of America Merrill Lynch ? 17.1%

  Over 13,000 people in the UK are using a new website to 
 get people to do the tasks they don't have time to do.  
  While some tasks 
 are mundane like cooking and cleaning, they can be more bizarre.  
  Past 
 tasks have included dressing up as a stormtrooper to walk a bride down the 
 aisle on her wedding day and flying to Texas to collect an engagement ring. 
  
  The UK is Airtasker's first market outside of Australia, where its Taskers 
 earn more than $100 million AUD each year.

 Over 2 million people are using a 'digital noticeboard' to hire strangers 
 to do extravagant tasks and errands ? and they involve stormtroopers and 
 fried chicken
summary: 
text1:  
 Over 13,000 people in the UK are using a new website to get people to do 
 the tasks they don't have time to do.  
  While some tasks are mundane like 
 cooking and cleaning, they can be more bizarre.  
  Past tasks have included 
 dressing up as a stormtrooper to walk a bride down the aisle on her wedding 
 day and flying to Texas to collect an engagement ring.  
  The UK is Airtasker's 
 first market outside of Australia, where its Taskers earn more than $100 
 million AUD each year.  
 
 
  Over 2 million people around the world ? 
 and now thousands in the UK ? are using a website to get people to do the 
 tasks they don't have time to get around to (or never dreamed someone would 
 do for them) ? and some of them are pretty bizarre. 
 Over 13,000 people 
 have signed up on Airtasker since it launched in the UK on March 12, its 
 first market outside of Australia. 
 The "community marketplace" acts as 
 a digital noticeboard of sorts to connect people and businesses with members 
 of the local community who are able to complete tasks to earn some extra 
 cash. 
 It has more than two million members globally, and claims its Taskers 
 earn more than $100 million AUD through the platform each year. 
 The most 
 common tasks ? of which around 5,000 are uploaded every day around the world 
 ? involve cleaning, removal, or jobs for handymen, but some are certainly 
 more creative. 
 In the first week following its UK launch, tasks being

 pub quiz, and even building a snowman in London's Finsbury Square for £55. 
 
 Since then, a lot of the tasks have been food-related. 
  Here, a Tasker 
 tracked down a sold-out Waitrose chocolate avocado easter egg...  
 
  
 
     
         
             
                  
             

         
                   When you NEED the avocado Easter eggs but they?re sold 
 out all over the city...get an Airtasker onto it! Tasker Agostina went above 
 and beyond to hunt down these treats and get them delivered. Task complete!

 Stormtroopers, engagement rings, 
 and fried chicken 
 Lucas London, Airtasker's UK Country Manager, said: 
 "The traction in terms of tasks/earning opportunities that we?ve seen in 
 the first two weeks in London is what took us two years to achieve in Australia." 
 
 The standard of request is even more bizarre in Australia, where tasks 
 have included flying to Texas to collect an engagement ring, dressing up 
 as a stormtrooper to walk a bride down the aisle on her wedding day, and 
 being paid to find the best fried chicken in Sydney. The company expects 
 this to become the case in the UK, too. 
 
  
     
         
          
    
                  
             

                           A long 
 time ago in a galaxy far, far away... Paul, Airtasker CTO, wanted his first 
 EVER task to be something costume related and FINALLY his dream came true 
 today he walked a beautiful bride down the aisle as a stormtrooper... Congrats

 That's according to 
 Sydney-born Airtasker cofounder and CEO Tim Fung, who told Business Insider 
 he came up with the idea while chasing success in more traditional ways. 
 
 After university, he started his career at investment bank Macquarie. 
 "My soul was crushed, but I learned a lot of great things," he said. 
 In 
 2009, he decided he wanted to do something more creative, and joined modelling 
 agency Chic Management ? which has worked with the likes of Miranda Kerr 
 ? with the goal of being "like [Hollywood agent] Ari Gold from 'Entourage.'" 
 
 He also jumped at an opportunity to work on a telecom startup, Amaysim, 
 which he called "like Ryanair in the mobile world." 
 The idea for Airtasker 
 didn't come about until 2011 when Fung was moving apartments in Sydney. 
 
   
 "I asked one of my friends, Ivan, to come help me move. He runs a 
 chicken nugget factory and he had a truck," he said. 
 Fung realised that 
 instead of asking friends and family to help us with tasks like moving, 
 assembling furniture, and packing boxes, there's no reason why we can't 
 be asking members of the community who could stand to make some extra cash. 
 
 "In our community, we tend to have really low trust," he said. "People 
 are pessimistic about people in their community and talk about them like 
 they're strangers. 
 "[This is about putting] some simple systems in place 
 to be able to trust people in your community." 
 Airtasker has raised $67 
 million in funding to date, according to the company. 
 It employs around 
 165 people around the world and completed a $35 million funding round in 
 October last year for its UK launch. 
 Fung says some Taskers are earning 
 $5,000 AUD (around £3,000) or more a month. 
 "You can definitely make a 
 viable career out of it," he said. "Our highest earner made £95,000 in 12 
 months last year." 
 How it works 
   
 It's a demand-driven marketplace, 
 according to Fung, which means users can say exactly what they're looking 
 for and have people come to them rather than the other way around. 
 "It's 
 not an agency model where you give your job to the agency and they go and 
 find you someone," he said. "All of the tasks on Airtasker are proactive 
 buy-in ? rather than the jobs getting pushed, the jobs just exist and the 
 workers can jump on." 
 It's free to post a task or sign up as a Tasker. 
 
 Once you post a task, you'll receive offers from Taskers, then can pick 
 the one that's right for your job.

 what you need done, on demand, on Airtasker - launching soon in the UK!

 Taskers can add a number of verification badges to their profiles ? 
 including trade licenses, ID checks, and background checks ? to promote 
 themselves on the platform. 
 "The minimum is a verified phone number. We 
 use more community verification vs. being a centralised background checking 
 business," he said, adding that their verifications come along with reviews 
 of the jobs they've done. 
 The more badges Taskers have, the more they're 
 able to charge. 
 "60% of the tasks are not awarded to the person who makes 
 the lowest offer ? most of the time people are choosing people who have 
 a bit more skill," he said. 
 However, the amount of experience and level 
 of verification required is up to you. "It's no different to if you were 
 hiring someone outside of Airtasker," Fung said. 
 "Of course if you?re 
 having someone come into your house like a babysitter, you want checks done. 
 If you want 20 people to be extras in a movie or hand out flyers in the 
 street, you probably don?t want such rigorous checks." 
 You pay by credit 
 card when you accept an offer, and once the job has been completed you hit 
 a "release" button and the funds get transferred to the Tasker right away. 
 
 If the Tasker has done a great job, you can choose to leave them a bonus 
 and if a task took longer or less time than expected, both parties can agree 
 to adjust the price. 
 Robots and transparency 
 While some of the tasks 
 are pretty bizarre ? one Australian woman offered $500 AUD for someone willing 
 to give her a secret pasta sauce after losing her grandmother's famous recipe 
 ? Fung said the site has a number of tools in place to ensure things don't 
 get out of hand. 
 Users must agree to the site's guidelines when they register 
 and can flag anything they see on the site as "inappropriate."

 Fung said Airtasker has also developed an AI robot, called Alan, 
 who "has learned from tasks that have been posted before, can predict what 
 isn?t going to meet our community guidelines, and pulls down stuff that?s 
 not appropriate." 
 He said the staff look at the tasks Alan has pulled 
 down to determine whether or not they're OK to be on the site. 
 Insurance 
 partner XL Catlin also covers cover Taskers for personal injury or property 
 damage whilst completing a task. 
 "We don?t want it to become something 
 like Craigslist has become in some areas of the world," Fung added. "The 
 number one thing for us is to create a culture of transparency."   SEE ALSO:&nbsp;

 that nobody in their right mind wants to visit it any more. Tourism has 
 experienced a so-called Trump Slump; with international visitors decreasing 
 significantly since No 45 took office. In January, the  UN World Tourism 
 Organisation said  that it expected Spain to replace the US as the world?s 
 second most popular tourism destination in 2018.   Now, to be fair to our

 trend began back in 2015 and can be partly attributed to a stronger dollar. 
 However, analysts are generally in agreement that Trump?s divisive rhetoric 
 and obsession with travel bans has done a lot to make international visitors 
 feel unwelcome and decide to go somewhere else on holiday.    Continue reading...

 Republicans have been using the Constitution?s flaws to wage a one-sided 
 war against their political opponents. It?s time for Democrats to respond 
   Donald Trump wasn?t elected because Democrats lost a policy fight in 2016. 
 What Democrats did was lose a procedural fight that has been going on since 
 the early 1990s, when Republicans began waging a relentless, brutal, and 
 completely one-sided war, systematically using their lawmaking power to 
 disadvantage their adversaries in elections and political mobilization. 
   Gerrymandering, the Citizens United atrocity that declared money is speech, 
 blocking US supreme court nominations and obstructing legislation are some 
 of the Republican party?s tactics. Depraved, racist voter ID laws that obviously 
 target people who are likely to vote Democratic, and the cruel way that 
 many states prevent current or former felons from voting are others.   Continue

 The Trick to Time by Kit de Waal review ? life on the fringes of sweeping 
 change
summary: 
text1:  
 An exile looks back on her Irish childhood and lost love ? and yearns for 
 something greater   Kit de Waal?s 2016 debut,   My Name Is Leon  , about 
 the differing fates of two fostered half-brothers, was a critical and commercial 
 hit. Her second novel, longlisted this month for the Women?s prize for fiction, 
 also draws on her Irish heritage for the protagonist Mona, who is almost 
 60, living alone, an exile in an England that has never quite felt like 
 home. Flashbacks gradually fill in the gaps to reveal both the tragic and 
 the mundane events that have brought her there.  Mona is an appealing heroine, 
 rich in skills and experience and not obviously lonely, though definitely 
 intrigued by the elegant man living opposite whom she occasionally glimpses 
 at his window. She sells dolls, unique collector?s items, painstakingly 
 dressed and posed in the elaborate window of her shop. A gifted woodcarver 
 crafts the bodies, which Mona then paints, sewing bespoke outfits for each 
 tiny individual. Always on the lookout for items to repurpose ? a broken 
 earring she can deconstruct into a fancy button, a cut-up vinyl pencil case 
 to turn into a pair of shiny boots ? Mona has similarly constructed a miniaturised 
 life from scraps. As her birthday approaches, she questions whether it is 
 too late to live on a larger scale.   Continue reading...

 How to grow your own veg: a beginner?s guide
summary: 
text1:  
 Fancy home-grown carrots, chard, coriander or cabbage? This is all you need 
 to know  First, write down which fruit, veg and herbs you love to eat, then 
 cross off those less likely to crop in the UK (bananas and avocados, say). 
 If space is at a premium, don?t grow inexpensive staples such as jacket 
 spuds, peas or onions. Instead, go for favourites that don?t store well, 
 are hard to come by or are best eaten minutes after harvesting: new potatoes, 
 baby carrots, sweetcorn, pak choi, yellow courgettes, garlic chives and 
 edible flowers.   Continue reading...

 Who says wine doesn?t go with eggs?
summary: 
text1:  
 If Elizabeth David can write a whole book on the subject of pairing wine 
 with egg dishes, then that?s good enough for me  Look up almost any guide 
 to food and wine pairing, and it will tell you that eggs don?t go with wine. 
 I?ve never really got that myself, and nor did Elizabeth David, who even 
 wrote a  book dedicated to the combination . And the problem is precisely 
 what?  Well, it turns out that it isn?t so much the taste as the consistency: 
 it?s held that the runniness of an egg yolk can make a wine, particularly 
 a classic red such as bordeaux, taste metallic. So if you?re planning a 
 brunch this weekend, what should you drink and what should you steer clear 
 of?   Continue reading...

 Survey finds generation of schoolchildren still paying the price for global 
 financial crisis  Teachers are reporting more pupils being squeezed into 
 classrooms, and ?filthy? working conditions because of fewer cleaners, as 
 budget cuts take effect on state schools across England, according to a 
 survey of teachers belonging to the National Education Union.  In a straw 
 poll of 900 members, the country?s largest union reported that one in five 
 said their schools were asking parents for financial contributions as a 
 result of budget pressures, while two-thirds said funding for special needs 
 provision had been cut.   Continue reading...

 In America, jails and prisons have become the nation?s de facto mental healthcare 
 providers ? and the results are chilling  In One Flew Over the Cuckoo?s 
 Nest, Ken Kesey describes two kinds of patients in the psychiatric hospital 
 where the story is set: Acutes (?because the doctors figure them still sick 
 enough to be fixed?) and Chronics (who are ?in for good, the staff concedes?). 
  When Kristopher Rodriguez, a 31-year-old man from Florida, first went into 
 the US criminal justice system in 2008, it seemed like he would have been 
 classified as an Acute; now nearly a decade later, he would almost certainly 
 qualify as a Chronic.   Continue reading...

 How Home-State Pronunciations Can Shape Elections
summary: As an expression of ?in-group? identity in American politics, how politicians say a state?s name can be powerfully symbolic.
text1:  
 Woe to the politician who, while campaigning in a particular state, pronounces 
 the state?s name differently from the local denizens.  The latest casualty 
 of this phonetic parochialism is Matt Rosendale, currently the frontrunner 
 among Montana Republicans seeking to oppose the incumbent Jon Tester in 
 this year?s U.S. Senate race. Democrats have already set their sights on 
 Rosendale by  issuing an online ad  that plays up the fact that he moved 
 to Montana from Maryland some fifteen years ago. His accent, the ad suggests, 
 is proof that Rosendale?dubbed ?Maryland Matt? by the Democrats?is an interloper 
 who doesn?t share ?Montana values.?      While Rosendale?s accent is indeed 
 distinctly non-Montanan, the ad focuses on his pronunciation of one word 
 in particular: ?Montana.? As befits someone of  Rosendale?s background  
 from Maryland?s Eastern Shore, there?s something peculiar about how he pronounces 
 the vowel in the second syllable of ?Montana.? (More on that in a bit.) 
  Rosendale is hardly the first politician to be ridiculed for his pronunciation 
 of a state name. In October 2016, Donald Trump tried?and failed?to pronounce 
 ?Nevada? the Nevadan way at  a rally in Reno . Locals prefer pronouncing 
 the second syllable like ?add? and bristle at outsiders saying it like ?odd.? 
 Trump must have been informed of this before the rally but still managed 
 to get it exactly backwards.      ?Heroin overdoses are surging and meth 
 overdoses in Nevada,? Trump said, making a point to pronounce it as ?Ne-VAH-da.? 
 He continued, ?And you know what I said? I said when I came out here, I 
 said nobody says it the other way, has to be Ne-VAH-da. And if you don?t 
 say it correctly, and it didn?t happen to me, but it happened to a friend 
 of mine, he was killed.?    As University of Pennsylvania linguist Mark 
 Liberman observed on  Language Log  at the time, ?it seems to tell us something 
 about Donald Trump's style that he tries to bond with Nevadans over right 
 vs. wrong ways to pronounce the name of their state?and gets it wrong.? 
  Julia Louis-Dreyfus, star of the HBO show  Veep , couldn?t help noticing 
 how life imitated art, since  Veep  featured a running joke about politicians? 
 inability to pronounce ?Nevada? the Nevadan way. On Twitter, she  shared 
 a video  intercutting Trump?s misstep with scenes from  Veep ?s fifth-season 
 episode appropriately entitled ?Nev-AD-a.?  
 A sobering documentary  @VeepHBO 
   pic.twitter.com/2ndsKbIHb3  
? Julia Louis-Dreyfus (@OfficialJLD)  October 
 7, 2016     If Trump had been more attentive to recent political history, 
 he might have known that in 2004 both George W. Bush and John Kerry were 
 criticized for using the ?Ne-VAH-da? pronunciation on the campaign trail. 
 As the   Las Vegas Review-Journal   reported at the time, Bush and Kerry 
 both eventually corrected themselves. When Bush made a point of using the 
 local ?add? pronunciation in a speech in Reno, he joked, ?I bet you didn?t 
 think I would get that right!?  It?s tricky for politicians, especially 
 on the national level, to ?get it right? when it comes to state names, since 
 very often variant pronunciations become shibboleths, delineating insiders 
 from outsiders. This is especially the case for state names derived from 
 Native American, Spanish, or French roots, which can be localized in idiosyncratic 
 ways.  An early example of a state making an issue of how to pronounce its 
 name is ?Arkansas? ?which in the nineteenth century was frequently said 
 as ?Ar-KAN-sas? by those from outside of the state. This became such a point 
 of contention that in 1881 the Arkansas General Assembly unanimously  adopted 
 a resolution  declaring that the proper pronunciation is ?AR-kan-saw.?  
 Since then, Arkansans have succeeded in propagating their preferred pronunciation. 
 Likewise, Illinoisans  insisted  that it?s ?Ill-i-NOY,? not ?Ill-i-NOISE.? 
 In some cases, local variants have simply faded away, such as the pronunciation 
 of ?Iowa? as ? I-o-way .? But other times, as with ?Nevada,? a variant remains 
 favored within the state?s borders but gets ignored by outsiders. Just ask 
 residents of Colorado (they tend to use the ?add? pronunciation like ?Nevada?) 
 or Oregon (they keep the final syllable unstressed instead of saying ?gone?). 
  ?Missouri? is another prominent example of a pronunciation split, with 
 many Missourians calling their state ?Mizzoura.? But there is a regional 
 complication: in  a poll by    Midwest Motorist   conducted in 1976, ?Mizzoura? 
 was favored in the western part of the state, while those in the east were 
 more likely to pronounce the final syllable as ?-ee.? A decade later, Missouri-born 
 humorist  Calvin Trillin  argued, semi-seriously, that Kit Bond?s defeat 
 of Harriet Woods in the state?s 1986 U.S. Senate race hinged on Bond?s use 
 of the more authentic ?Mizzoura? pronunciation.  Could Rosendale encounter 
 the same problem running for Senate in Montana? His situation is a bit different, 
 because ?Montana? does not actually have the same insider-outsider split 
 as, say, ?Nevada? or ?Colorado,? even though all three state names come 
 from Spanish roots. Most Americans, whether from Montana or elsewhere, would 
 pronounce ?Montana? to rhyme with ?banana,? using what linguists call the 
  TRAP   vowel  in the second syllable, rather than like ?nirvana,? which 
 uses the LOT vowel. (Apologies to British speakers and others who rhyme 
 ?banana? with ?nirvana.?)  So what?s going on with Rosendale?s ?Montana?? 
 As a native of the eastern shore of Maryland, he has a dialectal feature 
 known as the ? short-a split ,? common to the  Mid-Atlantic region  encompassing 
 Philadelphia and Baltimore. For speakers of this dialect, the TRAP vowel 
 becomes ?tense? in some words and ?lax? in others. You can hear this more 
 clearly by listening to  a clip  from Rosendale?s closing remarks in a recent 
 Republican primary debate.      In words like ?bad,? Rosendale makes the 
 TRAP vowel tense, something like ?bee-ud.? But his vowel in the second syllable 
 of ?Montana? is very lax, which can sound more like the LOT vowel to those 
 who lack a ?short-a split.? Christine Mallinson, a sociolinguist at University 
 of Maryland, Baltimore County, tells me that this vowel feature is typical 
 of white, working-class speech in the region where Rosendale grew up.  As 
 you can hear from the clip of Rosendale speaking, he has plenty of other 
 Mid-Atlantic dialect features, such as an ?o? diphthong that is ?fronted,? 
 or pronounced closer to the front of the mouth. ( ESPN?s Scott Van Pelt 
  can reduce fellow Marylander Tim Kurkjian to tears by pronouncing players? 
 names with a fronted ?o? in an exaggerated Baltimore accent.) But despite 
 all that, Montana Democrats are making the case that Rosendale is an East 
 Coast carpetbagger based solely on his pronunciation of ?Montana.? As an 
 expression of ? in-group ? identity in American politics, how you say a 
 state?s name can be powerfully symbolic.

 Bitcoin's Biggest Winners?or Losers?Are Likely to Be Men
summary: A thought experiment about risk-taking, equity, and gender.
text1:  
 After a long struggle for equality, it?s no longer controversial in the United 
 States that women are owed equal rights, equal dignity, equal protection 
 of the law, and the same economic opportunities as men. Yet disagreements 
 remain about what that means in practice and how far American are from realizing 
 that vision.  Lately, I?ve been pondering cryptocurrencies as a case study. 
 No one is quite sure if today?s investors in Bitcoin or Ethereum or Iota 
 will grow rich or lose everything. And that veil of ignorance is useful 
 for thinking through a fraught question: Will it be unjust if there is a 
 significant gender imbalance in investor losses or gains?  That outcome 
 is almost certain.  ?Data on who holds the anonymous currencies are hard 
 to find,? Hannah Kuchler  explains  in the  Financial Times , ?but Uphold, 
 a virtual currency wallet service that does background checks on its users, 
 says 75 percent are men, while Coin Dance, which tracks statistics on the 
 bitcoin community, found 97 percent of engagement was from men.?   Anne 
 Gaviola of CBC News  concurs. ?Figuring out exactly who is putting money 
 into this kind of asset is difficult because part of the attraction of investing 
 in the crypto realm is the assurance of anonymity,? she writes. ?But  survey 
  after  survey  backs up what the anecdotal evidence suggests?women are 
 underrepresented. Google Analytics results put the divide at 96.57 per cent 
 men to 3.43 per cent women.?  Simply put, many more men are buying crypto 
 than women. The combined market capitalization of all the currencies appears 
 to exceed 300 billion dollars. And due to their greater participation in 
 this extremely volatile and thus highly risky realm, men will likely wind 
 up squandering hundreds of billions of dollars more than women?or else, 
 perhaps, enjoying hundreds of billions in additional wealth.  Our uncertainty 
 about the outcome of this natural experiment presents an opportunity to 
 probe questions of risk-taking, gender, and equity behind a veil of ignorance. 
  If present trends persist and men in aggregate choose to risk much more 
 than women, will an aggregate difference in gains or losses in this realm 
 be just or unjust? Would it change your answer if cryptocurrencies upended 
 the financial system and the balance of wealth rather than constituting 
 a relatively small portion of it?  Does it matter if risk-taking is driven 
 by nature or nurture or both?  And if you?re uncomfortable with the unequal 
 outcomes on the horizon, is there an aspect of policy or socialization you?d 
 change that could alter the future in some way?  I?d love to air varying 
 perspectives sent to conor@theatlantic.com (specify if I should publish 
 your name or not). And I have three additional thoughts to inform responses: 
   This is a thought experiment about people who are investing money in crypto 
 currencies?something that can be accomplished online in 10 minutes with 
 nothing but a credit card and a Coinbase account?as distinct from earning 
 money as an entrepreneur in the crypto industry, where there is documented 
  evidence of a gendered culture  that imposes higher barriers to entry on 
 women. Let?s set aside gains to industry insiders as a distinct question. 
 
	 Gender differences in socialization, disposable income, and other factors 
 presumably affect investment in cryptocurrencies to one degree or another. 
 Respondents are welcome to point out such factors, but I?d be additionally 
 interested if they think there are any crypto gains or losses  not  explained 
 by these factors. 
	 Emails articulating why you have or haven?t invested 
 in cryptocurrency, or how you?ve thought about the question, are also welcome 
 as part of this discussion. Has gender played any role in your decision 
 about whether to buy or not? 
  Whatever happens next to cryptocurrencies, 
 it?s hard to see how the outcome will be equitable. Hopefully the exercise 
 of thinking all of this through can help folks on all sides of related questions?and 
 undecided, curious people like me?to clarify their own views, to understand 
 others, and to think through outcomes that are likely in our future.

 No Judges Confirmed This Week (senate is on another extended break)
summary: 
text1:   
 This will be a weekly post. Count remains at 29 judges. McCain remains in 
 Arizona, intentionally helping to paralyze the Senate, won&#x27;t resign 
 and won&#x27;t vote, writing his stupid book, The Washing Wave or whatever 
 its title is. McConnell could change the 30 hour cloture rule, but is probably 
 conveniently one vote short and he &#x22;just can&#x27;t do it.&#x22; So 
 Trump&#x27;s appointees wait and wait wait...until the end of the Congress, 
 when they all hope the democrats can take over and block Trump&#x27;s nominees 
 legitimately.

summary: 
text1:   
 This fictional family, and the show&#x92;s very real creator, are further 
 normalizing Trump and his warped, harmful political ideologies. There are 
 times when we can consume problematic pop culture, but this is not one of 
 those times. I saw the first two episodes of the &#x93;Roseanne&#x94; reboot, 
 but that&#x92;s all I am going to watch. It&#x92;s a small line to draw, 
 but it&#x92;s a start.

 &#x22;Hubble confounds cosmology by not finding Dark Matter&#x22;
summary: 
text1:   
 Using the Hubble Space Telescope astronomers have discovered a nearby galaxy 
 that apparently has little or no evidence of dark matter. The unique galaxy, 
 called NGC 1052-DF2, contains at most 1/400th the amount of dark matter 
 that astronomers had expected. The galaxy is as large as our Milky Way, 
 but it had escaped attention because it contains only 1/200th the number 
 of stars.

 Local Church Leaves United Methodist Church Over Its Support for Abortion
summary: 
text1:   
 A Mississippi United Methodist Church recently voted to leave its denomination, 
 in part, because of the denomination&#x92;s position on abortion. In the 
 past, the United Methodist Church has been affiliated with the pro-abortion 
 group Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice, and some of its pastors 
 continue to support pro-abortion causes. The denomination does not describe 
 abortion as a sin, either. Its position statement describes abortion as 
 a &#x93;complex&#x94; issue. It says: &#x93;Our belief in the sanctity of 
 unborn human life makes us reluctant to approve abortion. But we are equally 
 bound to respect the sacredness of the life and well-being of...

 15 things nurses know that others don't
summary: 
text1:  
 Being a  nurse  is an incredibly challenging yet rewarding career,  nurses 
  say.  
  Every day is different, and each new shift offers plenty of learning 
 opportunities.  
  So we asked nurses to share the best things they've learned 
 in their line of duty that others probably don't know.  
 
 
 &nbsp; 
 Successful 
 nurses are unflappable, unstoppable, and incredibly hardworking. From delivering 
 a baby to saving a  patient 's life, they've seen it all. 
 They're often 
 the unsung heroes of hospitals and doctor's offices everywhere, providing 
 comfort and care to those who need it most. 
 And with such incredible professional 
 experiences behind them, you can bet nurses know a thing of two that us 
 mere mortals don't. 
 Business Insider spoke to three nurses and scoured 
 Quora and nursing blogs to discover the most useful lessons nurses have 
 learned on the job.   SEE ALSO:&nbsp; Nurses share the 12 funniest things

 nurses understand   
 'Uh' is a dead giveaway for when patients are lying 
 
 
   "The most common tell for a lie is a hesitation followed by 'Uh.'" 
  
  &mdash; Quora user  Tasha Cooper Poslaniec &nbsp;wrote   
   Vicks Vapor 
 Rub isn't just good for stuffy noses 
 
   "I know a lot of nurses who use 
 Vicks Vapor Rub to line the inside of their mask to stop smells. You can 
 also use it to massage onto sore legs and feet after a long shift."  
  
 &mdash; Amy, a nurse with six years' experience, told Business Insider  
  
   The full moon affects patients behavior 
 
   "It's well known that 
 if you do a night shift on a full moon you're in for a crazy 12 hours. I 
 don't know what it is about the moon that makes patients go nuts. I've had 
 patients trying to send SOS messages in Morse code by flicking the lights 
 on and off."  
  &mdash; Danielle, a nurse with five years' experience, 
 told Business Insider

 These two college buddies quit their jobs on the same day, and eleven years 
 later they?ve raised $100 million to rule the ?sneakerhead? market
summary: 
text1:  
 Cofounders Eddy Lu and Daishin Sugano's story doesn't start  with the sneaker 
 app GOAT .  
  The two developed thick skin from failed venture after failed 
 venture before launching the online sneaker marketplace in 2015.  
    Now 
 the company has a fresh $60 million in funding with traction and popularity 
 to match.    
 
 
  Eddy Lu and Daishin Sugano quit their boring corporate 
 jobs on the same day eleven years ago.&nbsp; 
 The two college friends had 
 no idea they would eventually run a super-buzzy online sneaker marketplace 
 called  GOAT  that has scooped up nearly $100 million in funding and has 
 7 million fervent users. Sneakers were the furthest thing from their minds. 
 And it would be many years, and many failed business ventures, before the 
 duo found the right formula by tapping into the passionate ranks of sneakerheads.&nbsp; 
 
 At the time, the only thing the two budding entrepreneurs knew was that 
 they didn't want their corporate lives and they had a hunch that  the recently 
 released iPhone  would provide an important platform for new types of businesses.&nbsp; 
 
  "We were just like, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s do a business together,'" Lu tells 
 Business Insider.&nbsp;  
  The multiyear journey took Lu and Sugano to 
 different cities and different industries, not to mention through the  depths 
 of the financial downturn . And the events that led them to create GOAT 
 is a case study in the perseverance, passion and simple chance that often 
 form the basis of a startup success story.&nbsp;  
  "In our wildest dreams 
 we never thought this would really happen," says Sugano, 37, shortly after 
  GOAT announced the acquisition of Flight Club , an iconic sneaker store 
 that will give the startup its first retail presence.  
  Certified tea 
 masters and cream puffs  
  Lu and Sugano, who both grew up in LA, each 
 had contacts in China. So they first gave the Import/Export business a try.&nbsp; 
 They launched a golf apparel company, during which time Lu took sewing classes 
 to hone his seamster skills. They ran an online tea business and to this 
 day can call themselves certified tea masters as a result of the endeavor. 
 They built countless 99 cent gaming apps for iPhone users. Nothing stuck. 
 
 One day the two wandered into a Beard Papa's restaurant in LA, and, blown 
 away by the flaky, custard-filled cream puffs in their hands, decided to 
 franchise the Japanese chain for some "passive income" while they worked 
 on their projects. But it was 2008, the financial crisis was in full swing 
 and, because of the downturn, they couldn't hire managers.&nbsp; 
  &ldquo;Going 
 through 2008 as a business owner you definitely earn your stripes," said 
 Lu.  
 Lu and Sugano's cream puff days were painful, but they taught the 
 entrepreneurs fiscal responsibility and resilience. And it provided the 
 spark for their next adventure.&nbsp; 
 Who wants to eat with strangers? 
 
 In 2010 Lu and Sugano&nbsp;moved to Chicago with the intent of expanding 
 upon Beard Papa's presence in the Windy City. Once there, they discovered 
 how difficult it can be to meet people in a new city. 
 So they founded 
 GrubWithUs, a dining app that arranges meals between strangers. The concept 
 was innovative: reserve a seat at a participating restaurant for a meal 
 that piques the user&rsquo;s interest. When four people reserve a spot for 
 the same meal at the same table, the meeting is set, and a handful of lonely 
 strangers could socialize with their peers over dinner. 
 The startup got 
  funding from Y Combinator , and the two moved back to California in 2011 
 to run GrubWithUs from there. But the app never became very popular.&nbsp;Users 
 either had too many dietary restrictions for the meals listed in the app, 
 didn't like the menu, thought the restaurant was too far away, or were too 
 skittish about having dinner with unfamiliar faces. GrubWithUs gradually 
 fizzled out over the next few years.&nbsp; 
 Everything changed thanks to 
 a pair of fake Air Jordans.&nbsp; 
  Sugano has been a bona fide sneaker 
 enthusiast and basketball player since at least ten years old when his dad 
 bought him his first pair of Air Jordan 5 Grapes. In 2013, the shoe was 
 re-released 23 years after its debut&nbsp;(Michael Jordan&rsquo;s jersey 
 number was 23).&nbsp; 
 When he saw the Grapes were made available once 
 again, he acted fast. 
 &ldquo;Nostalgia hit me, I saw the photos: I had 
 to have the shoe again,&rdquo; Sugano recalls. So he turned to eBay, which 
 was then the largest sneaker marketplace. He mined the site for the shoe, 
 ordered it, and when it showed up on his doorstep, he realized it was a 
 fake. 
 When he complained to Lu about how the online sneaker market had 
 no authentication process, Lu asked him if there was room in the industry 
 for a brand devoted to monitoring fraudulence between sellers and buyers. 
 
 &ldquo;I did my due diligence and came up with nobody,&rdquo; said Sugano. 
 &ldquo;From that point on, we decided that this is something we could solve.&rdquo; 
 
 They launched GOAT shortly after in July of 2015, hoping the sneaker app 
 would live up to its namesake (Greatest Of All Time.) 
 A Black Friday fiasco 
 that turned into a blessing 
 The founders started off with $7.6 million 
 in funding from a handful of venture firms,  including Reddit cofounder 
 Alexis Ohanian.  
 Their first step was to build and refine an authentication 
 process to combat fraud in the online sneaker market. 
 Both sellers and 
 buyers use the app, with sellers required to apply before they can sell 
 their sneakers. They&rsquo;re also required to take standardized photos 
 from different angles of the shoe, i.e. the heel, the sole and the lateral 
 sides, which are then processed. GOAT uses these images to build a database 
 of what authentic sneaker models look like - and how to spot replicas. 
 
   
 &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a combination of image recognition with machine learning 
 because we get so many of the same type of shoes in our building every single 
 day,&rdquo; said Lu. 
 Only once the sneaker passes the authentication process 
 does it become activated for sale. From then on the seller interacts with 
 buyer offers and receives a shipping label from GOAT once a sale has been 
 made. Then the item is sent to either the company's Culver City or New Jersey 
 distribution center, quality controlled, further authenticated and shipped 
 out to the customer in a GOAT-designed shoe box all in one day. 
 Lu and 
 Sugano had learned their lesson with GrubWithUs: remove as much friction 
 as possible for consumers in the marketplace and make it easy for the product 
 to leave the seller's hands and ship to the buyer's door. 
 After four months 
 of operation, in November of 2015, the then-nobody company launched a Black 
 Friday campaign discounting the hottest styles of the year at retail prices. 
 
 &ldquo;That year we were talking about the Turtle Doves, the Supreme Fives,&rdquo; 
 said Lu. &ldquo;The internet picked it up and it kind of blew up, and every 
 kind of blog picked up this Black Friday campaign.&rdquo; 
 Over a hundred 
 thousand users installed the app to take advantage of the sale, causing 
 the newly-launched startup app to crash repeatedly. Some users got in, but 
 mostly everyone was shut out from access to the discounted sneaks. 
 &ldquo;We 
 were pretty hated in the community then, but at that point it was better 
 to be hated than to be unknown,&rdquo; said Lu. 
 Tapping into star power 
 on court and off court 
 The Black Friday fiasco put GOAT on the map, and 
 the company hasn't stopped growing since.&nbsp; 
 The app currently has 
 7 million users, up from one million at this time last year.&nbsp;There 
 are 100,000 sellers on the app and the marketplace has more than 400,000 
 sneakers,&nbsp;including iconic kicks like the Yeezy Boosts, Nike Air Max&rsquo;s 
 and the  Chanel X Pharrell&rsquo;s , which are listed at $20,000. 
 The 
 company does not disclose its financial results, other than saying it's 
 revenue last year increased 500%. The company says that sellers on its platform 
 have&nbsp;raked in a collective $2 million in sneaker sales.&nbsp; 
  The 
 brand is building its buzz through events like the after party it hosted 
 during the&nbsp;NBA All-Star Weekend in Los Angeles this year. Houston Rockets 
 point guard James Harden hosted the event.&nbsp; 
 And GOAT is building 
 up its bench internally, bringing on  former Twitter COO Adam Bain  to its 
 board last year.&nbsp; The company's headcount has swelled to 300 employees 
 on staff, up from 20 employees two years ago.&nbsp; 
 After raising $60 
 million in fresh funding from Index Ventures, Accel and other venture capital 
 firms last month, GOAT is embarking on its next phase of growth beyond the 
 app. In February it acquired Flight Club, which has retail locations in 
 Los Angeles and New York.&nbsp; 
 GOAT also recently launched a bi-annual, 
 150 plus-page lifestyle magazine for the brand called &ldquo;Greatest&rdquo; 
 spotlighting people across various industries that are defining their own 
 success stories. 
 But despite the company&rsquo;s wild success, the founders 
 know they've been fortunate. They know they've caught a culture wave, one 
 that paying sneakerheads are glad to ride. It's a humbling experience that 
 the guys work to keep in mind. 
 "It is funny because we did an all-hands 
 meeting yesterday and you&rsquo;re talking and there&rsquo;s a hundred something 
 people in the audience as opposed to just two years ago when we had less 
 than twenty people," said Lu. "Yeah, we&rsquo;ve just been very fortunate."

 The Family Weekly
summary: Highlights from this week?s coverage on relationships and family life
text1:  
 The Family Weekly  Welcome back to ?The Family Weekly.? Every Saturday morning, 
 we?ll send you a selection of our favorite stories from  The Atlantic ?s 
  Family section . We?re excited to have you join us as we explore questions 
 about family life and human relationships.   This Week in Family  The movement 
 that emerged in the wake of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, has 
 been driven by young people?but it has also revealed interesting dynamics 
 between young and old. Rachel Gutman, an editorial fellow at  The Atlantic 
 ,  was surprised  when her grandfather, who hadn?t been to a demonstration 
 since the 1960s, traveled from Florida to attend the March for Our Lives 
 in Washington, D.C., last Saturday. What led him to protest? As her grandfather 
 put it: ?I said to myself, you know what, you have missed so many moments 
 in history because you hesitated and didn?t pay attention. Don?t miss this 
 one.?  And teens are genuinely interested in a conversation with the generation 
 before them: Today?s rebels are, in a break from history, seeking more in 
 the way of adult protection and support. ?Kids demand that their voices 
 be heard, but they aren?t pushing back against adult vigilance,?  observed 
   The Atlantic? s literary editor, Ann Hulbert. ?They want more of it, not 
 less.?   Snapshot     Rachel Gutman?s grandfather  attended  the March for 
 Our Lives demonstration in Washington, D.C., last Saturday. (Rachel Gutman 
 / Katie Martin /  The Atlantic )   The Big Question  What does regularly 
 scheduled family time mean to kids and parents? A 100-year-old Mormon ritual, 
 for which families gather once a week to pray, play games, and spend time 
 together, keeps the ideal of family time alive:  
 More than 100 years after 
 family home evening was conceived, it has taken on new relevance in a modern, 
 fast-paced culture. ? [Parents] talked about how useful family home evening 
 is in pushing back on this speeding-up of the everyday. One parent we interviewed 
 said that one of his kids finds the ritual boring, and while he says his 
 child is not always wrong, he notes ?every once in a while it just clicks. 
 ? It?s a real feeling of oneness as a family.? One young teen we talked 
 to felt similarly. She said family home evening ?brings you away from all 
 of the stuff of the world? and ?gives you a chance to realize that they?re 
 your family.? 
  How do you carve out family time? Read the  piece , by 
 David C. Dollahite and Loren Marks, and tell us your story in  Homebodies, 
   The Atlantic ?s Facebook group on family life.   Dear Therapist  Every 
 Wednesday, the psychotherapist Lori Gottlieb answers readers? questions 
 about life?s trials and tribulations, big or small, in  The Atlantic ?s 
 ?Dear Therapist? column.  This week, a parent worries when she hears about 
 her 18-year-old son?s dreams of becoming a stand-up comedian?a career path 
 she fears will find him living in her basement at age 35. Lori?s  advice: 
   
 It?s natural for parents to feel that our job is to impart wisdom to 
 our children?in part, it is. But sometimes we forget that our children have 
 wisdom to bestow on us, too. Throughout their lives, in hundreds of ways, 
 our children are teaching us about control?how illusory it is, how futile 
 our attempts to maintain it are, and how liberating letting go can be, for 
 everyone involved. The good news is, you don?t have to choose your son?s 
 path for him?because the reality is, you don?t get to. 
  Send Lori your 
 questions at dear.therapist@theatlantic.com.

 about it. (Dinged by UCLA with a 4.1 GPA ... totally predictable given acceptance

The Beginning of the End? 
 Key Takeaways From PIMCO&rsquo;s Cyclical Outlook


Stormy weather was abundant 
 in March: spring snowstorms in the Northeast of the U.S., a trade tussle 
 with China that could escalate into a trade war, hawkish personnel changes 
 in the White House, a Powell-led Federal Reserve that expects to overshoot 
 the neutral policy rate, and the worst week for U.S. equities since January 
 2016. 
 Could this be the beginning of the end? This is the question we 
 ask in our latest &nbsp;   Cyclical Outlook  , which summarizes the conclusions 
 from PIMCO&rsquo;s quarterly Cyclical Forum held earlier this month. If 
 you haven&rsquo;t read the outlook, you may wonder: &ldquo;The beginning 
 of the end of &hellip; what?&rdquo; Here are three variations of the question, 
 along with our answers. 
 The beginning of the end of &hellip; extreme monetary 
 accommodation?

 15 things nurses know that others don't
summary: 
text1:  
 NBC/"ER"    
 
  Being a  nurse  is an incredibly challenging yet rewarding 
 career,  nurses  say.  
  Every day is different, and each new shift offers 
 plenty of learning opportunities.  
  So we asked nurses to share the best 
 things they've learned in their line of duty that others probably don't 
 know.  
 
 
 &nbsp; 
 Successful nurses are unflappable, unstoppable, and 
 incredibly hardworking. From delivering a baby to saving a  patient 's life, 
 they've seen it all. 
 They're often the unsung heroes of hospitals and 
 doctor's offices everywhere, providing comfort and care to those who need 
 it most. 
 And with such incredible professional experiences behind them, 
 you can bet nurses know a thing of two that us mere mortals don't.

   "I know a lot of nurses who use Vicks Vapor 
 Rub to line the inside of their mask to stop smells. You can also use it 
 to massage onto sore legs and feet after a long shift."

   "It's well known that if you 
 do a night shift on a full moon you're in for a crazy 12 hours. I don't 
 know what it is about the moon that makes patients go nuts. I've had patients 
 trying to send SOS messages in Morse code by flicking the lights on and 
 off."

  The two developed thick skin from failed

  Eddy Lu and Daishin Sugano quit their 
 boring corporate jobs on the same day eleven years ago.&nbsp; 
 The two 
 college friends had no idea they would eventually run a super-buzzy online 
 sneaker marketplace called  GOAT  that has scooped up nearly $100 million 
 in funding and has 7 million fervent users. Sneakers were the furthest thing 
 from their minds. And it would be many years, and many failed business ventures, 
 before the duo found the right formula by tapping into the passionate ranks 
 of sneakerheads.&nbsp;    See the rest of the story at Business Insider

 What Makes John Bolton So Dangerous
summary: 
text1:  
 ?Snowpocalypse.&#8221; ?Robo-apocalypse.? ?Retail apocalypse.? 
 Casual references 
 to annihilation pop up every day in American life. That makes it harder 
 to communicate the danger posed by Donald Trump?s appointment of John Bolton 
 as National Security Advisor. 
 Bolton has poor judgment, a mean spirit, 
 and an intellect that?s weaker than he thinks. He spreads ethnic hatred 
 and argues for sending others to fight and die.

 This weekend, young people around the country stood 
 up against gun violence in their schools. Bolton?s appointment tells us 
 that senseless violence may soon dominate our foreign policy, too, even 
 more than it already does. 
 Bolton seems to pursue Machiavelli?s dictum 
 that  ? it is much safer to be feared than loved.? But it?s not safer. As 
 we?ve learned from Bolton?s past mistakes, foolish wars bring fresh dangers 
 as well as needless tragedies. 
 Machiavelli also said, ?The first method 
 for estimating the intelligence of a ruler is to look at the men he has 
 around him.? This appointment confirms what many of us already thought about 
 Trump?s intelligence. 
 But Bolton?s no Trumpian deviation from social or 
 political norms. He?s a political insider, beloved by think-tankers and 
 mainstream media outlets alike. They?re already clucking their tongues in 
 disapproval at Bolton?s appointment, but it?s all for show. 
 Bolton?s one 
 of them.   read more

 the HPV vaccine, which protects them against cervical cancer. Boys are not 
 given the vaccine, even though the virus is known to cause cancers of the 
 head and neck in men in later life. Health officials have argued that administering 
 the vaccine to boys is not cost-effective.   Continue reading...

 How to make the perfect chocolate souffle
summary: 
text1:  
 This is a great showstopper for Easter, and it?s nowhere near as hard as 
 some recipes make out  Regardless of religion, the one thing that unites 
 us as nation at Easter is our boundless appetite for chocolate eggs ?  we 
 spend £220m a year on the things . If you?re out to impress, however, turn 
 those eggs into a chocolate souffle instead: richly flavoured, yet featherlight, 
 it?s the perfect end to an Easter feast and, crucially, far easier to pull 
 off than its fearsome reputation suggests. Not that your guests need to 
 know that, of course.   Continue reading...

 TV presenter Steph McGovern: how I eat
summary: 
text1:  
 The face of BBC Breakfast has to get up at 3.30am, so what kickstarts her 
 day? I get up at 3.30am. We?re on air from 6am, so if I?m in the studio, 
 I?ll have eggs at around 7am from the canteen ? scrambled or poached, occasionally 
 with a slice of brown toast. If I?m on the road, though, say, a factory 
 visit, it?ll be a bacon butty with the team. Which is great, a real treat. 
 But it?s all downhill from there.   Continue reading...

 Restaurant chains still force waiting staff to give up some tips
summary: 
text1:   
 Practices persist as restaurants struggle with weak consumer spending and 
 higher minimum wage The government has come under renewed pressure to crack 
 down on restaurants that ask waiters to hand over some or all of their tips. 
 As restaurateurs feel the pinch from a combination of the rise in the  national 
 minimum wage , increased competition and flagging consumer spending, there 
 is concern that some are using a variety of methods to withhold tips from 
 staff.  These include: requiring staff to pay a percentage of the sales 
 they have generated back to the restaurant; persuading all staff to  cut 
 their wage rate to the legal minimum  and make up the difference using tips; 
 and asking waiters to  hand over some of their tips to kitchen staff  in 
 lieu of the latter receiving a wage rise.   Continue reading...

 The big picture: Easter Sunday, 1958
summary:

 The late Observer photographer Jane Bown turns her natural eye for studies 
 of children to a moment of seasonal longing  Jane Bown took this picture 
 for the  Observer ?s Easter Sunday paper exactly 60 years ago. It shared 
 the front page with a couple of stories. One reported on the unseasonable 
 holiday weather, the 1958 equivalent of the ?beast from the east?, with 
 a forecast that included ?snow, sleet, rain, ice, flooding and fog?.  The 
 other dwelt on the previous day?s Aldermaston peace marches. The  Observer 
 ?s celebrated feature writer John Gale had evidently been dispatched in 
 search of some ?colour? and his report delivered: ?There was a young girl 
 among those carrying the large banner of the Twickenham branch of CND, (a&nbsp;painted 
 group of father in dark suit and mother in blue, and small child in yellow 
 in her arms) and she&nbsp;had very pink legs below her green jeans??   Continue

 Edie Falco Anchors the Romantic Drama of  Outside In
summary: Lynn Shelton?s new film centers on an uneasy relationship between an ex-con and the woman who helped free him from prison.
text1:  
 Lynn Shelton is a director whose films thrive in the quieter moments?an awkward 
 glance shared between characters, or a casual, improvised conversation. 
 From mumblecore-style low-budget comedies like  Humpday  to more mainstream 
 efforts like  Laggies , Shelton has always held on to a raggedy sort of 
 realism, drawing out major story details from small personal interactions. 
 Her new film  Outside In , which she wrote with the movie?s lead actor Jay 
 Duplass, is slightly more melodramatic than her previous works. But its 
 central plot of an ex-con returning to life after 20 years in prison is 
 less pulpy than it sounds.  Like every other Shelton movie, this is mostly 
 a tale about human connection, and how those bonds are tested, stretched, 
 and ultimately changed. Chris (a bearded, taciturn Duplass) went to jail 
 as an 18-year-old for a crime he didn?t commit; at age 38, he?s finally 
 free, helped by a campaign waged by his former high-school English teacher 
 Carol (Edie Falco). It?s their lingering bond, and the strange ethical fault 
 lines running through it, that fascinates Shelton.  Outside In  takes some 
 time to develop that tension into something genuinely dramatic, but Falco?s 
 performance is strong enough to make the film compelling even in its softest 
 moments.    A relationship between a former teacher and student is morally 
 complicated no matter the specifics of the scenario, but Shelton and Duplass 
 have plotted a very particular quandary for the viewer to work through. 
 For all Chris?s years in prison, Carol was his closest friend, the only 
 one who believed in him enough to stay in regular touch and fight for him. 
 At the same time,   Chris became the focus of a mid-life crisis of sorts 
 for Carol, and her connection with him began to disrupt her marriage. Both 
 were sounding boards for each other, and living far apart made it easier 
 to confess their secrets.  Chris, who?s on parole and confined to living 
 with his screw-up brother Ted (Ben Schwartz), is naturally not very trusting 
 after his time behind bars. Carol is stuck in a marriage to the gruff, distant 
 Tom (Charles Leggett), and the couple appear to be years removed from any 
 real intimacy. So it makes sense that Chris and Carol would be drawn closer 
 together, although their respective situations are annoyingly one-dimensional 
 at times. Tom is an absurdly unfeeling partner who?s openly hostile from 
 his first minute on screen. And Ted does just about everything wrong in 
 trying to welcome his brother back to society, like throwing surprise parties 
 populated by the ghosts of Chris?s high-school past and tempting him with 
 alcohol and drugs.  Falco and Duplass have enough chemistry as it is, but 
 the rest of the world seems to be conspiring to nudge Chris and Carol into 
 an affair anyway. So Shelton introduces another element: Carol?s teenage 
 daughter Hildy (Kaitlyn Dever), who develops a crush on Chris. This kind 
 of loose, vaguely creepy love triangle is a specialty for Shelton, who centered 
 her 2012 film  Your Sister?s Sister  on another familial romance. But  Outside 
 In  never veers into particularly transgressive territory, since this is 
 a movie that?s more broadly about making complicated choices.  As Chris, 
 Duplass is disappointingly flat. Though other characters treat him as somewhat 
 intimidating (there are references made to his more hard-edged behavior 
 as a teenager), there?s nothing especially threatening about his demeanor. 
 At best, he?s a man whose senses have been dulled by his imprisonment, and 
 who only seems to come alive with Carol. Even there, Falco is doing the 
 heavy lifting. It?s hardly news that she?s an extraordinary actress, but 
 this is still a rare role for her?a nuanced leading part in a film that 
 lets her play a real, flawed human being with passion and depth.  Falco 
 makes watching Carol come out of her shell with Chris a thrilling experience, 
 and the repercussions (good and bad) that follow feel entirely earned thanks 
 to her work. She can suggest so much with a wrinkled forehead or a stuttered 
 line delivery; few actresses can communicate their characters? public persona 
 and private fears as economically. It?s one of the best performances of 
 the year so far, and Falco is more than enough to make  Outside In  worth 
 seeing, even if its narrative shortcuts sometimes frustrate.

 The Unfulfilled Promise of Fair Housing
summary: Martin Luther King Jr.?s dream of an integrated America was about creating a more equal society, but to many white homeowners, it was a threat.
text1:  
 Editor&rsquo;s Note:  Read  The Atlantic ?s  special coverage  of Martin 
 Luther King Jr.?s legacy.    ?Kill him,? a white mob chanted as Martin Luther 
 King Jr. marched across Marquette Park in the late summer of 1966. King 
 had recently moved to Chicago, and on that August afternoon, he joined a 
 Chicago Freedom Movement march to demand that realtors not discriminate 
 against black residents seeking to live in white neighborhoods. But a group 
 of white counter-protesters  grew violent  and started hurling rocks, bottles, 
 and bricks at the demonstrators, eventually  striking King in the head . 
 ?I?ve been in many demonstrations all across the South, but I can say that 
 I have never seen?even in Mississippi and Alabama?mobs as hostile and as 
 hate-filled as I?ve seen here in Chicago,? he said, shining light on a problem 
 that white Northern liberals had ignored and let fester for far too long: 
 de facto segregation.  Up until the civil-rights era, segregation was largely 
 reinforced, if not promoted, by federal and local governments. In the 1930s, 
 for example, the Federal Housing Administration incentivized developers 
 to build suburbs for whites only, and the Public Works Administration built 
 separate and unequal housing projects. After a series of Supreme Court cases 
 deemed segregation unconstitutional in the 1940s and ?50s, American neighborhoods 
 continued to segregate without legal recognition, in a system known as ?de 
 facto.? And like de jure segregation?when the government legally engineered 
 ghettos into existence?de facto segregation continues to exacerbate wealth 
 and racial inequality today.    In spite of King?s civil-rights work in 
 the North, which focused on fair and open housing, resistance to integration 
 has been commonplace in liberal and conservative places alike, firmly rooted 
 in sentiments similar to the ones behind the 1930s housing policies that 
 systematically disadvantaged African Americans. Earlier this year, when 
 the Trump administration  delayed an Obama-era rule  that incentivized metropolitan 
 areas across the country to desegregate, it was not acting out of step with 
 the nation?s long history of housing discrimination. In fact, since King?s 
 death, the government has seldom taken seriously its promise to desegregate 
 communities, and most of its efforts to do so have been lackluster. That?s 
 no accident; it?s a response to many white constituents who don?t want to 
 see integration happen.  The continued resistance to integration is not 
 about residents bending to the will of a free market; it?s about the preservation 
 of white wealth, a measurable guarantee for the advancement of white Americans 
 at the cost of everyone else. That means better schools for white children; 
 better job opportunities for white professionals; and better health care 
 for all white Americans. There?s a fear that white wealth cannot exist without 
 black poverty, and so some see segregation as an essential tool to keep 
 that dichotomy alive.   The violence that King faced in Marquette Park didn?t 
 come out of nowhere. While the segregationists of the South irked the white 
 Northerner?s conscience, the segregated realities of Chicago or New York 
 seemed more nuanced. To them, Northern segregation was an issue of economics, 
 not race?though their vehement resistance to integration indicates it was 
 at least a combination of the two. King?s renewed focus on the racist housing 
 structures of progressive metropolitan areas cost him the support of white 
 allies, and he grew increasingly unpopular in the last few years of his 
 life. But his assassination, and the riots that ensued, prompted Congress 
 to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1968?a part of which is the Fair Housing 
 Act?and turn his vision for Chicago into federal law.  Yet 50 years later, 
 America is still sharply segregated. According to a study by the Brookings 
 Institute,  76 percent  of black Chicago-area residents, for example, would 
 have to move in order to fully integrate the region, and  another study 
  showed that some cities like Los Angeles are  resegregating . That?s partly 
 because up until recently, the federal government left a critical part of 
 the Fair Housing Act behind: the requirement to  affirmatively  further 
 fair housing. While the law is mostly known for outlawing racial discrimination 
 in real estate, it also called for a government program to desegregate communities. 
 ?People forget that the second part of the Fair Housing Act was to actively 
 promote an integrated society,? Brian Gilmore, a law professor at Michigan 
 State University, said. ?And you need to not just promote it, you need to 
 actually make it happen.?  But since President Lyndon Johnson signed the 
 Fair Housing Act into law, serious integration efforts on the federal level 
 have been curbed. Johnson?s immediate successor, Richard Nixon, derailed 
 his own secretary of Housing and Urban Development?s integration program, 
 which withdrew federal funds from jurisdictions that did not comply with 
 the civil-rights law. The secretary, George Romney, had been committed to 
 reversing the segregated housing patterns that the government helped engineer, 
 saying that the suburbs were a ?high-income white noose? around black inner 
 cities. But Romney?s program, which he called ?Open Communities,? faced 
 backlash from Nixon?s political advisers, and the president publicly denounced 
 it as ?forced integration.?  Nixon?s views on housing ran directly against 
 King?s dream of an integrated America. ?I am convinced that while legal 
 segregation is totally wrong,? Nixon wrote, ?forced integration of housing 
 or education is just as wrong.? Much to the delight of his reelection campaign, 
 Nixon successfully thwarted Romney?s program and eventually forced the secretary 
 out of his administration.  A 2012  ProPublica  investigation found  that 
 since then, HUD has only twice held federal funds from jurisdictions for 
 violating the Fair Housing Act. In fact, Nixon?s early steps to dismantle 
 the housing act were so influential that 40 years after Romney resigned, 
 his son, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, suggested that he 
  may eliminate HUD  altogether during a private fundraiser for his 2012 
 campaign.  ?The reason that an aggressive program like [George Romney?s] 
 hasn?t been done since is that there?s no political support for it,? said 
 Richard Rothstein, a research associate at the Economic Policy Institute 
 and author of  The Color of Law . ?And part of the reason there?s no political 
 support for it is because we?ve adopted this myth that the government wasn?t 
 responsible for segregation, and so there?s no governmental responsibility 
 for undoing it.?    The reality, however, is that the government is uniquely 
 responsible for creating slums, which King viewed as ?a system of internal 
 colonialism not unlike the exploitation of the Congo by Belgium.? In the 
 1930s, the government-sponsored Home Owners? Loan Corporation  introduced 
 the private-sector to redlining  when it produced color-coded maps of urban 
 areas; black neighborhoods were marked in red, which indicated that they 
 were the riskiest areas to insure mortgages. Consequently, white residents 
 received virtually all loans from the Federal Housing Administration between 
 1934 and 1962. ?But for this kind of government policy, we would not have 
 the segregated patterns that we have today,? Rothstein said.  The FHA was 
 so determined to keep African Americans out of white neighborhoods that 
 it provided methods for doing so in its underwriting manual, which  stated 
  that ?natural or artificially established barriers will prove effective 
 in protecting a neighborhood and the locations within it from adverse influences 
 ? [which] includes prevention of the infiltration of business and industrial 
 uses, lower class occupancy, and inharmonious racial groups.? As Rothstein 
 writes in his book, the FHA favored areas that built highways through and 
 between neighborhoods to keep them separated on the basis of race. In one 
 instance, the FHA refused to guarantee loans for homes in a Detroit development 
 adjacent to a black neighborhood unless the developer  built a wall  to 
 keep the black neighbors out. ?The reason federal agencies are on the hook 
 in the first place is that they created the segregated and unequal society 
 that we have today,? Katherine O?Regan, a former HUD official, said.  As 
 Rothstein  told WHYY?s Terry Gross , the FHA rationalized their segregation 
 tactics on the faulty premise that  home values would depreciate  if African 
 Americans moved into?or near?white neighborhoods. But this was not the case. 
 ?The reality is that when African Americans moved into white neighborhoods, 
 the property values went up simply because African Americans were willing 
 to pay more for housing than whites since their supply was so restricted,? 
 Rothstein told me. In fact, property values only declined when real-estate 
 agents scared homeowners into selling their properties at a low price by 
 telling them that black and brown residents were moving into their neighborhood?a 
 practice known as blockbusting. (The realtors would then proceed to resell 
 those homes to African Americans at higher prices.)   Part of the reason 
 that fair and open housing, of all of King?s legacies, has had such difficulty 
 gaining traction is that homeowners are particularly sensitive about losing 
 control of their neighborhoods. ?A lot of civil rights was about making 
 the South behave and taking the teeth from George Wallace,? Walter Mondale, 
 who co-authored the Fair Housing Act,  said in an interview for  ProPublica 
  . ?This came right to the neighborhoods across the country. This was civil 
 rights getting personal.?  Today, many homeowners still operate under the 
 same unfounded notion that the FHA used to promote its racist housing policies. 
 ?I think that there is a perception that people of color are inferior neighbors, 
 and that they bring down the value of a neighborhood,? said Cedric M. Powell, 
 a law professor at the University of Louisville. Throughout the nation?s 
 history, there has been a persisting racist notion that blackness cheapens 
 the value of society, while only whiteness can enrich it. That begins to 
 explain why white residents continue to resist integration; the mere perception 
 of black residents in a neighborhood stirs worry of declining housing prices. 
 It also explains why  establishments don?t want black customers ; why  Hollywood 
 executives don?t want black actors ; why  white voters don?t want black 
 representatives ; and why the president wants  immigrants from Norway instead 
 of Haiti . In that sense, the struggle for fair housing is no different 
 than any other struggle in America: It poses a threat to white wealth, a 
 threat of a more equal society.  While white homeowners are worried about 
 property value depreciation, many African Americans don?t have the privilege 
 of sharing such a concern. As of 2016, the median net worth of white families 
 is  close to 10 times  that of their black counterparts. ?The refusal of 
 the FHA to permit African Americans into the suburbs that it was creating 
 is primarily responsible for that wealth gap,? Rothstein said. ?While the 
 white working class bought homes in places like Levittown and gained wealth 
 from the appreciation of their properties, African Americans?who were explicitly 
 prohibited by federal regulation to buy those homes?gained none of that 
 equity.?  Integration won?t happen on its own. That?s why King envisioned 
 a government effort to actively reverse the segregation patterns that it 
 created. ?Saying, ?let people choose to live wherever they want? is not 
 enough,? O?Regan said. But Ben Carson, the current secretary of HUD, believes 
 that the Obama administration?s ?Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing? 
 rule was a case of ? social engineering ??the idea that a government push 
 for integration is unnatural because it defies market forces. It may well 
 be that encouraging low-income residents to move to middle- and upper-class 
 neighborhoods is social engineering, but integration is no more a case of 
 social engineering than segregation was and continues to be.  With the recent 
 delay of the ?Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing? rule, integration will 
 become more difficult to achieve. ?Any place that had an inclination to 
 possibly continue policies that perpetuate segregation, this delay gives 
 them more freedom to do that,? O?Regan said. In postponing the rule, the 
 Trump administration is following in Nixon?s footsteps, making yet another 
 attempt to dismantle the Fair Housing Act and, in a broader sense, King?s 
 legacy.  While explicit racial exclusion is illegal, economic exclusionary 
 zoning laws, which disproportionately impact people of color, still exist 
 in major American cities. When the case of Arlington Heights, a Chicago 
 suburb, made it all the way to the Supreme Court in 1977 for rejecting to 
 build multi-family units?a tactic that discourages lower-income people from 
 moving into the neighborhood?the Court decided that the zoning ordinance 
 was constitutional. Five months ago, that same Chicago suburb  rejected 
 a proposal  to build a multi-family apartment building because of its proximity 
 to a single-family neighborhood, citing concerns that it was not the right 
 fit for the area. ?There are racially prejudice attitudes on the part of 
 the white population that resists any effort to integrate,? Rothstein said. 
 ?It?s masked as economic elitism, but it?s fundamentally racially based.? 
 In 2017, Arlington Heights was still less than 2 percent African American. 
  When King was asked about the violent incident in Marquette park, he said, 
 ?Oh, I?ve been hit so many times I?m immune to it.? But after 50 years of 
 devastating blows, it seems his legacy is not.

 Some 250 protesters marched through Sacramento late Friday night and converged 
 onto a restaurant which welcomed them just hours after an autopsy revealed 
 that Stephon Clark was shot by police six times in the back. The protesters 
 gathered at City Hall and chanted for about half an hour before beginning 
 a march through the streets of the California state capital.

 The Senate is sitting on 78 of President Trump&#x92;s nominees who have already 
 been passed out of committee but can&#x92;t get a floor vote. Chuck Schumer 
 and his loyal band of Democrats accomplish this obstruction by objecting 
 to unanimous consent that a nomination be taken up. This triggers a motion 
 for cloture which brings with it 30 hours of floor debate. The Wall Street 
 Journal, in an editorial denouncing the Democrats&#x92; practice, notes 
 that cloture votes used to be almost unheard of for nominations other than 
 judges. At this point in the past four presidencies combined, only 15 executive-branch 
 nominees...

 'God knows we don't like him': Mexico's former ambassador to China explains 
 how Mexico ?and the world ? reacted to the first year of Trump
summary: 
text1:  
 AP Photo/Andy Wong    
 Jorge Guajardo spent nearly a decade in Mexico's 
 diplomatic corps, serving as consul general in Austin, Texas, from 2005 
 to 2007 before moving to China, where he became one of  Mexico's longest-serving 
 ambassadors to that country , leaving in 2013. 
 Outside of his diplomatic 
 positions, both of which he was appointed to by presidents from the conservative 
 National Action Party, he has worked in Mexican domestic politics, as press 
 secretary and communications director for the Nuevo Leon state governor, 
 also of the PAN, from 1997 to 2000, and in public affairs in the US. He 
 remains active in Mexican politics. 
 Business Insider sat down with Guajardo 
 in Washington, DC, in mid-March to discuss the first year under President 
 Donald Trump, from his perspectives as both a Mexican and a former diplomat. 
 The conversation below has been edited for length and clarity.  'There is 
 still uncertainty' 
  REUTERS/Ludovic Marin/Pool 
   Christopher Woody : 
 There was a story back in August,  a McClatchy story , it came out just 
 after the transcript of Trump's phone call with [Mexican President &nbsp; 
 Enrique Pe&ntilde;a Nieto] leaked, and apparently the contents of the call 
 were the source of some amusement for the diplomatic community. The conversation 
 in question was within Trump's first couple weeks in office. We're now over 
 a year into his term. What's the mood among diplomats about Donald Trump 
 and about his administration? 
  Jorge Guajardo : I would say it's less 
 concerning in some areas, inasmuch as people have, I would say the diplomatic 
 community has gotten to understand that they should indeed ignore most of 
 his Twitter as white noise &mdash; distractions, if you will. 
 On the other 
 hand there's uncertainty, and as diplomats you try to do away with the uncertainty 
 and try to find ways of working out. So I think there is still confusion 
 &mdash; for instance, you may come as foreign-government envoy or as a diplomat 
 and you engage with your counterparts here, only to have it unravel because 
 the president may tweet in another direction or just undo everything you 
 had worked [for]. 
 So even though there is less uncertainty with regards 
 to everything blowing up in your face, there is still uncertainty into how 
 much your counterparts are actually speaking for the administration, and 
 you see a secretary of state who goes out and says something only to be 
 disavowed by the president, and the same applies to most other areas. So 
 that's complicated.  
   'If martians come down and take Jared Kushner away 
 ...' 
  Reuters/Carlos Barria 
   Woody : How would you assess the Mexican 
 government's handling of its interactions and relations with the US government? 
 
  Guajardo : I'm not a big fan of the way they've been handling these things. 
 
 Now mind you, they've been dealt a difficult card, but ... I would highlight 
 two things. Their insistence in bringing the two presidents together. I 
 don't see what the point is. I think the president of the United States 
 is dead-set on insulting the Mexican president at every opportunity he has. 
 It's just going to create problems for Mexico if they get together. So I 
 don't see why they keep insisting on having this. I don't see what legitimacy 
 they're aiming for in this summit. 
 On the other hand, they've put all 
 their eggs in Jared Kushner's basket. I guess because it has worked for 
 them, but I tend to think it's better to institutionalize the relationship, 
 and if you go through the State Department or the respective institutions, 
 you're better positioned to withstand any shocks. 
 For instance, if Jared 
 Kushner leaves tomorrow, for whatever reason &mdash; or as we used to say, 
 if martians come down and take Jared Kushner away &mdash; you're safe because 
 you have your institutional relationship, and I think the Mexican government 
 has not been very good at keeping the institutional relationship, in order 
 to favor Jared Kushner as a channel.  
   'Whatever the case, Mexico will 
 have a new government come December 1' 
  Mexican Foreign Ministry 
   Woody 
 : People I've spoken to, political scientists,  they've said the same thing 
 : If you rely on these personal connections to establish diplomatic relations, 
 you put yourself at the mercy of the longevity of those people in office. 
 
  Guajardo : Exactly, and that's a problem. Not only is it a problem for 
 you, as a counterpart to the United States, but for your successor as well. 
 
 Because whatever the case, Mexico will have a new government come December 
 1, and it is this current administration's responsibility to ensure that 
 there is a good transition, a working transition, and when you have done 
 everything through your personal connections with Jared Kushner, well it 
 doesn't necessarily provide for an institutional transition of power, since 
 the incoming administration may not have that personal relationship with 
 Kushner. 
 If you have done everything institutionally through the respective 
 channels, it will be easier for the incoming administration, of whichever 
 party it may be.

title:   
 This is the most beautiful phone I've ever seen ? here's how it was made
summary: 
text1:  
 "Someone finally made a phone for  me ." 
 That was my first thought when 
 I unwrapped the ocean depths Essential Phone, which is neither blue nor 
 green, but a deep jewel tone. 
 It's made out of ceramic, and around the 
 edge is a shiny, copper-colored titanium band. Altogether, it's a color 
 combination that's never been used on a smartphone before &mdash; and it's 
 quite possibly the best-looking phone I've ever seen.&nbsp; 
 The Essential 
 Phone, which is the brainchild of Android creator Andy Rubin,  launched 
 in August 2017 . The phone debuted at $700, but its  price was slashed by 
 $200  a few months later amid reports of poor sales. Last month, research 
 firm IDG estimated that Essential had  sold fewer than 90,000 phones , a 
 fraction of what Apple and Samsung typically sell.&nbsp; 
 Still, there's 
 no denying that the Essential Phone is one of the more innovative smartphones 
 to launch in recent years, and after using the device for a few weeks, I 
 wanted to know how Essential's designers came up with the design for its 
 phone &mdash; and why they chose such unusual color combinations. 
  I talked 
 with Linda Jiang, Essential's head of industrial design and the woman responsible 
 for creating one of the most beautiful and unusual phones you can buy:  
   SEE ALSO:&nbsp; 6 reasons you should buy Samsung's new Galaxy S9 instead 
 of the Galaxy Note 8   
 With the Essential Phone ? technically called "PH-1" 
 ? Jiang and her team were starting from scratch. 
 
   "It was actually 
 really liberating," Jiang told Business Insider. "Rather than focusing on 
 a previous design and evolving it, we just started from the inside out. 
 Design is one thing, but what are the technologies we want to feature, and 
 what are some ways we can really push the boundaries of what a smartphone 
 can be?"  
  Jiang said she wanted the Essential Phone to be "  function 
 first," meaning she didn't want there to be a lot of flash, or distractions 
 from the technology itself.&nbsp;   
   If you look closely, you'll notice 
 something different about the Essential Phone: it doesn't have any logos 
 or branding on the back. 
 
   The Essential Phone's lack of logos is unusual 
 compared to other high-end smartphones.   
  Apple slaps its logo right 
 on the center of the phone. Samsung places two different logos on that back 
 of its Galaxy phones. Google places a small but noticeable "G" on the back 
 of the Pixel.&nbsp;  
  But Jiang says Essential eschewed branding from 
 the beginning, and wanted "the design to be the brand."   
  Instead of 
 logos, Jiang says, Essential made design choices like adding magnetic connectors 
 for accessories like  Essential's 360 camera .&nbsp;  Essential's goal was 
 to make the phone look different enough from the back that people would 
 know who made it.&nbsp;  
  Plus, Jiang says she thinks logos aren't what's 
 best for consumers.&nbsp;  
  "Sometimes it&rsquo;s not fair to the customers 
 to have this giant brand slapped on the back of the phone," Jiang said. 
 "They're basically just walking advertisements &mdash; 'whether you like 
 it or not, you&rsquo;re doing to be advertising for us.'"   
   The front 
 of the Essential Phone looks like an average smartphone ? except for the 
 notch. 
 
   The Essential Phone came out in August, which means its "notch" 
 &mdash; that cut-out towards the top of the display that houses the front-facing 
 camera &mdash; pre-dates the iPhone X.&nbsp;  
  Since then, Android makers 
 have started  adding the notch to their own designs , which Jiang says is 
 "gratifying."  
  "It was actually controversial within our own company; 
 some people hated it, some people loved it," Jiang said. "But we kind of 
 felt like, we're trying to do something that's never been done before and 
 it was actually a nice thing to know that it started such controversy."

title:   
 'They can't afford to be precious' ? why lots of advertisers aren't playing 
 hardball with Facebook
summary: 
text1:  
 Even as many top marketers go public in their criticism of Facebook's handling 
 of the Cambridge Analytica controversy, there's another side to the story. 
  
  There are thousands of advertisers on Facebook who are not even thinking 
 about cutting or threatening to cut Facebook ads.   
  That's because these 
 brands rely on Facebook to generate much if not all of their business. "They 
 can't afford to be precious," one executive says.  
 
 
 Big advertisers 
 have been letting  Facebook  have it. 
 But lots of advertisers aren't shouting 
 about the  Cambridge Analytica  fallout. They simply can't afford to. 
 
 Recently giant marketers like Procter &amp; Gamble and  Unilever  have been 
  rethinking how much they need to advertise  via  digital media at all. 
  And they're getting fed up with Facebook's misadventures with consumer 
 data and reluctance to employ third-party measurement to the degree they'd 
 prefer. 
 Following the Cambridge mess, big advertisers have become more 
 emboldened to push back,  reported the Wall Street Journal. &nbsp;That's 
 led Facebook's sales chief to spend much of her time  doing damage control. 
  
 But there's another side to all this &mdash; and it's important to remember 
 that&nbsp;Facebook has 6 million advertisers. So many of the advertisers 
 that thrive on Facebook, as well as Google, Instagram, and other platforms, 
 are not of the Procter &amp; Gamble ilk.   Instead of worrying about how 
 Facebook will replace their shrinking TV audiences, these brands have built 
 their business on Facebook. That means cutting ads on Facebook means cutting 
 off their own business. 
 "Of course these kinds of brands care about brand 
 safety," said Sam Appelbaum,&nbsp;General Manager at YellowHammer Media 
 Group, which specializes in brands that sell directly to consumers via digital 
 media. "But they can't afford to be precious. Advertising on Facebook is 
 crucial for driving their business. And in some cases, its where most of 
 their business is generated." 
 That's not the case for most of the big 
 marketers who are shouting about Facebook's data ills. Those companies often 
 don't have their own consumer data, and many of them rely on selling their 
 wares in physical stores.&nbsp; 
 And they've developed their brands in 
 a traditional media, Madison Avenue-image-focused era. So any association 
 with consumer data breaches, fake news, Russian bots, etc. are greeted with 
 a desire to protect their good names. 
 "Those guys are 100% focused on 
 their image and the PR angle. We&rsquo;re focused on generating customers," 
 said  Brian Schwartz , partner at Fuego Box, a startup that sells high-end 
 hot sauce consumers, primarily via social media. 
 Of course, Fuego Box 
 cares about its brand, said Schwartz. And if Facebook or Google or another 
 outlet proved to be clearly detrimental to their image, they'd have to rethink 
 things.&nbsp; 
 But&nbsp;Fuego Box and the thousands of other marketers 
 like them don't always have the luxury to threaten to cut spending from 
 a giant platform to negotiate or prove a point. Which in a way likely insulates 
 Facebook from too much damage. 
 "There's stuff that&rsquo;s in our control, 
 and stuff that's out of our control," he said.&nbsp;You kinda have to bake 
 everything in how you evaluate your media spending. But for the most part, 
 if it works it works, it doesn&rsquo;t it doesn't." 
 Or as one exec from 
 a large, direct-to-consumer brand put it: "We&rsquo;re a performance marketer...[Facebook 
 has]the audience...So fewer decisions based on politics and values and more 
 based on performance."   Join the conversation about this story &#187;

 The 2018&nbsp; New York Auto Show  will see major car reveals from brands 
 such as  Acura ,  Cadillac ,  Nissan , Jaguar,  Mercedes-Benz ,  Toyota 
 , and Volkswagen.  
  The show will have more of a focus on cars for everyday 
 life instead of  Geneva's supercars  bonanza.   
  The New York International 
 Auto Show is open to the public now and will run until April 8.  
 
 
  
 After the annual supercar festival that was the  Geneva Motor Show , the 
  New York International Auto Show  is a much more laid-back affair with 
 a focus on cars that will one day find their way to your local showroom. 
 
 This year, the big story is crossover SUVs. And they are here en masse, 
 in every color, size, and price point imaginable. It makes perfect sense 
 because crossovers are the hottest segment of the market.&nbsp; 
  &nbsp; 
  This year, major brands such as Acura,  Audi , Cadillac, Genesis, Honda, 
 Hyundai, Kia, Lincoln, Nissan,&nbsp; Jaguar , Subaru, Toyota,&nbsp;and  
 Volkswagen &nbsp;all unveiled important new product offerings.&nbsp;  
 
  The 2018 New York Auto Show is open to the public and will run until April 
 8 at the Javits Center.   
  Here's a quick rundown of some of the coolest 
 and most important cars at this year's show:    SEE ALSO:&nbsp; We drove

 This year, the New York Auto Show is 
 dominated by mainstream, mass-market brands. Crossovers and SUVs are especially 
 present. Leading the way is the Volkswagen Atlas Cross Sport. It's a five-seat 
 crossover concept based on the brand's existing seven-seat Atlas SUV. 
 
 
   Alongside the Cross Sport, you'll find the Volkswagen Atas Tanoak Concept. 
 It's a crossover utility truck concept that may one day make it to US showrooms. 
 
 
   Other heavy hitters to debut at the show include the 2019 Toyota RAV4

 tended to stick with me for some time. So it was with some surprise I turned

 jogging, or "Jess shuffling", as my friends call it.

 IDENTITY VERIFICATION IN BANKING: How banks are using new authentication

 Business Insider's premium research service. To learn more about BI Intelligence,&nbsp;click

 The way incumbent banks onboard and verify the identities of their 
 customers online is inconvenient and insecure, resulting in lowered customer 
 satisfaction and loyalty, and security breaches leading to compensation 
 payouts and legal costs. 
 It&rsquo;s a lose-lose situation, as consumers 
 become disgruntled and banks lose business. The problem stems from the very 
 strict verification standards and high noncompliance fines that banks are 
 subject to, which have led them to prioritize stringency over user experience 
 in verification. &nbsp;At the same time, this approach doesn't gain banks 
 much, since the verification methods they use to remain compliant can actually 
 end up compromising customers' personal data.     See the rest of the story

  President Donald Trump has continually announced 
 trade actions only to temper the move later.  
  Economist Gregory Daco 
 says it's like "somebody playing with a knife on a playground."  
 
 
 President 
 Donald Trump spent the month of March talking tough about trade. One economist 
 thinks that could come back to bite him in the long-term. 
 Gregory Daco, 
 chief US economist at Oxford Economics, says&nbsp; Trump developed a pattern

 concessions from other countries before dialing back the original measure.

 This is the most beautiful phone I've ever seen ? here's how it was made
summary: 
text1:  
 Hollis Johnson/Business Insider   "Someone finally made a phone for me." 
 
 That was my first thought when I unwrapped the ocean depths Essential 
 Phone, which is neither blue nor green, but a deep jewel tone. 
 It's made 
 out of ceramic, and around the edge is a shiny, copper-colored titanium 
 band. Altogether, it's a color combination that's never been used on a smartphone 
 before &mdash; and it's quite possibly the best-looking phone I've ever 
 seen.&nbsp; 
 The Essential Phone, which is the brainchild of Android creator 
 Andy Rubin,  launched in August 2017 . The phone debuted at $700, but its 
  price was slashed by $200  a few months later amid reports of poor sales. 
 Last month, research firm IDG estimated that Essential had  sold fewer than 
 90,000 phones , a fraction of what Apple and Samsung typically sell.&nbsp; 
 
 Still, there's no denying that the Essential Phone is one of the more 
 innovative smartphones to launch in recent years, and after using the device 
 for a few weeks, I wanted to know how Essential's designers came up with 
 the design for its phone &mdash; and why they chose such unusual color combinations. 
 
  I talked with Linda Jiang, Essential's head of industrial design and 
 the woman responsible for creating one of the most beautiful and unusual 
 phones you can buy:   With the Essential Phone ? technically called "PH-1" 
 ? Jiang and her team were starting from scratch. 
  Antonio Villas-Boas/Business 
 Insider 
   "It was actually really liberating," Jiang told Business Insider. 
 "Rather than focusing on a previous design and evolving it, we just started 
 from the inside out. Design is one thing, but what are the technologies 
 we want to feature, and what are some ways we can really push the boundaries 
 of what a smartphone can be?"  
  Jiang said she wanted the Essential Phone 
 to be "  function first," meaning she didn't want there to be a lot of flash, 
 or distractions from the technology itself.&nbsp;   
   If you look closely, 
 you'll notice something different about the Essential Phone: it doesn't 
 have any logos or branding on the back. 
  Antonio Villas-Boas/Business 
 Insider 
   The Essential Phone's lack of logos is unusual compared to other 
 high-end smartphones.   
  Apple slaps its logo right on the center of the 
 phone. Samsung places two different logos on that back of its Galaxy phones. 
 Google places a small but noticeable "G" on the back of the Pixel.&nbsp; 
  
  But Jiang says Essential eschewed branding from the beginning, and wanted 
 "the design to be the brand."   
  Instead of logos, Jiang says, Essential 
 made design choices like adding magnetic connectors for accessories like 
  Essential's 360 camera .&nbsp;  Essential's goal was to make the phone 
 look different enough from the back that people would know who made it.&nbsp; 
  
  Plus, Jiang says she thinks logos aren't what's best for consumers.&nbsp; 
  
  "Sometimes it&rsquo;s not fair to the customers to have this giant brand 
 slapped on the back of the phone," Jiang said. "They're basically just walking 
 advertisements &mdash; 'whether you like it or not, you&rsquo;re doing to 
 be advertising for us.'"   
   The front of the Essential Phone looks like 
 an average smartphone ? except for the notch. 
  Antonio Villas-Boas/Business 
 Insider 
   The Essential Phone came out in August, which means its "notch" 
 &mdash; that cut-out towards the top of the display that houses the front-facing 
 camera &mdash; pre-dates the iPhone X.&nbsp;  
  Since then, Android makers 
 have started  adding the notch to their own designs , which Jiang says is 
 "gratifying."  
  "It was actually controversial within our own company; 
 some people hated it, some people loved it," Jiang said. "But we kind of 
 felt like, we're trying to do something that's never been done before and 
 it was actually a nice thing to know that it started such controversy."

  Last year, the Goldman Sachs partner 
 David Dase uprooted his family and moved to Atlanta to start a new investment-banking 
 office for the firm.  
  The move was part of a broader effort by Goldman 
 Sachs to penetrate regional business hubs, including Dallas, Seattle, and 
 Toronto.   
  The initiative is a key component in achieving the firm's 
 goal of covering more than 1,000 new companies and adding $500 million in 
 new investment-banking revenue.  
  Starting from scratch, Dase quickly 
 enmeshed himself in the Atlanta community, and the firm is now covering 
 50 new companies in the region.  
 
 
 David Dase knew moving to Atlanta 
 wouldn't be easy. 
 The Goldman Sachs partner had spent much of his nearly 
 25 years at the firm orchestrating deals in the US's busiest financial hubs 
 &mdash; New York and San Francisco &mdash; where the investment bank was 
 entrenched in corporate boardrooms of the world's most important companies.

  JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon is the 
 best of Wall Street's top executives, according to ratings from investors 
 compiled by  Procensus .  
  Of the nine global bank CEOs rated, Dimon ranked 
 the highest overall as well as in four of the six "competencies" the CEOs 
 were judged on.  
  Morgan Stanley's James Gorman came in second, and he 
 beat out Dimon on ratings for market communication and hitting financial 
 plans and targets.  
  While the top-rated CEOs had strong stock performance, 
 it wasn't a perfect indicator of investor favor. Citigroup's Michael Corbat 
 ranked seventh despite the bank's strong performance in the past year.  
 
 
 
  JPMorgan Chase  dominates  nearly every Wall Street business , so 
 it's not exactly a shock that investors consider Jamie Dimon the best of 
 all the big-bank CEOs. 
 But Dimon isn't the top performer in every competency 
 required of a Wall Street executive.  Morgan Stanley  CEO James Gorman is 
 superior at market communication and executing on company plans and financial 
 targets, according to a wide swath of buy-side investors.    See the rest

 It makes perfect sense that Trump would take on Amazon ? but Amazon is going 
 to be a brutal foe
summary:

 Drew Angerer/Getty Images    
 
  Donald Trump is "obsessed" with Amazon, 
 in the words of Axios.  
  He thinks the online retailer has unfair advantages 
 and is putting traditional companies out of business.  
  Trump talks about 
 Amazon like he talks about the foreign trade partners, and he may want to 
 start a domestic version of a trade war.  
  But Amazon is the best-liked 
 large company in America and will be a tough enemy.  
 
 
  The most obvious 
 explanation for President Donald Trump's antipathy for Amazon &mdash; and, 
 I'm sure, one of the main contributing factors &mdash; is that Amazon founder 
 Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post, which Trump hates. 
 But there must 
 be more to it than that.    See the rest of the story at Business Insider

 The Galaxy S9 has 11 great features buried in the settings you should check 
 out
summary: 
text1:  
 Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider   Android phones can be customized way 
 more than iPhones, and Samsung adds its own little touches that take customization 
 to another level.&nbsp; 
 The thing is, Samsung rarely mentions these cool 
 little features when it announces its new phones, and they can go unnoticed 
 for your entire ownership of a Samsung phone.&nbsp; 
 Many of the features 
 mentioned here aren't exclusive to Samsung's new phone, the Galaxy S9. You'll 
 find most of them in previous models, too, but I added them to the list 
 just in case you missed them.&nbsp; 
  Check out 11 cool tips and tricks 
 for your Galaxy S9 :  1. Make the screen even sharper. 
  Business Insider 
 
  Out of the box, the Galaxy S9's screen is set to 1080p. That's somewhat 
 odd considering the display's native resolution is a sharper 1440p. 
 You 
 can set the phone to make full use of its sharp display by heading to&nbsp; 
 Settings &gt; Display &gt; Screen resolution,&nbsp; then set it from FHD+ 
 to WQHD+. 
 Setting the display to a higher resolution means you'll take 
 a small hit on battery life, but it's not a dramatic difference by any means. 
 The sharpness difference isn't massive, but it's there, and you get the 
 full effect of Samsung's smartphone displays that are the best in the business.&nbsp; 
  
   2. Make the screen less harsh-looking at night time. 
  Business Insider 
 
  Many phones have this feature now. Apple calls it Night Shift, Samsung 
 calls it Blue Light Filter. It basically reduces the intensity of bright 
 blue colors that can appear overly bright and keep your brain awake when 
 you're trying to wind down around night time. 
 Head to&nbsp; Settings &gt; 
 Display &gt; Blue light filter &gt; Turn on as scheduled.&nbsp; You can 
 set it for the default sunset to sunrise, or set the feature to run during 
 your own custom times.&nbsp;  
   3. Squeeze more apps onto your home screen. 
 
  Business Insider 
  By default, the Galaxy S9's home screen positions 
 its apps pretty far apart from each other, and it doesn't give you much 
 control of where you want the app icons to go.&nbsp; 
 Head to&nbsp; Settings 
 &gt; Display &gt; Home screen &gt; Home screen grid . There, you can set 
 it to show more apps that you can position closer together.&nbsp;

 MLB MESSAGE BOARDS WERE DISCONTINUED
summary: 
text1:   
 About two weeks ago I went to my team&#x27;s MLB chat page and it was gone! 
 I guess MLB decided that it was an expense they no longer wished to incur. 
 I am hoping that our vast array of baseball fanatics will know of other 
 sites where the daily game can be discussed as it is played, and have other 
 conversations on current events.

 Madison Councilwoman Objects to Armed Bank Guards [semi-satire]

 After one of her constituents was killed while attempting to rob a bank,

 to deploy armed guards is a desperation measure that comes too late to achieve 
 the best results,&#x22; Hall contended. &#x22;It foments an arms race between 
 those who have money...

 California governor pardons 5 men facing deportation
summary: 
text1:   
 California Gov. Jerry Brown on Friday pardoned five ex-convicts facing deportation, 
 including two whose families fled the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia four 
 decades ago. The pardons don&#x27;t automatically stop deportation proceedings, 
 but eliminate the state convictions federal authorities based their deportation 
 decisions on. That gives the men&#x27;s lawyers strong legal arguments before 
 immigration judges to try to prevent the deportations. &#x22;The pardon 
 does provide enormous benefit to immigrants facing deportation,&#x22; said 
 Anoop Prasad, an immigration staff attorney at Asian Law Caucus. Brown&#x27;s 
 intervention for the men &#x97; among 56 pardoned &#x97; marked the Democratic 
 governor&#x27;s third consecutive pardon round...

 We pitted the Apple Airpods against the Jaybird RUN wireless headphones ?

  Totally wireless earbuds are the future of headphones 
 because of their sheer convenience.   
  We pitted our current favorites 
 &mdash; the wildly popular&nbsp; Apple Airpods  and the cult-favorite&nbsp; 
 Jaybird RUN wireless headphones &nbsp;&mdash; against each other to determine 
 which pair of earbuds is most worth your money.  
  After judging each pair 
 based on audio quality, design, connectivity, battery life, fit, and other 
 special features,&nbsp; the Jaybird RUNs  ended up on top.  
  The RUNs 
 won out because of their practical design, better-feeling fit, and the ability 
 to customize their sound through a companion app.  
 
 
 Totally wireless 
 earbuds are gaining in popularity, and it's easy to see why: They're incredibly 
 convenient, and the technology used to make them has gotten a whole lot 
 better recently. 
 We pitted our current favorites &mdash;&nbsp; Apple's 
 Airpods  and  Jaybird's RUN  earbuds &mdash; against one another in six 
 tests:&nbsp;audio quality, design, connectivity, battery life, fit, and 
 extras. After everything was said and done, the Jaybird RUNs came out on 
 top, despite losing in the audio quality test. 
 Before committing to either 
 pair, I also highly recommend reading Insider Picks' full reviews of&nbsp; 
 Apple's Airpods  and  Jaybird 's RUN  earbuds.  Audio quality: The Airpods 
 edge out the RUNs with their more balanced sound. 
  Maurizio Pesce/Flickr 
 
  Audio quality is the most important factor when picking a pair of headphones, 
 so it makes sense to start there.&nbsp; 
  The Airpods &nbsp;sounded very 
 good during my testing. With a relatively balanced sound that's a little 
 treble heavy and bass light, these are good headphones for everyday listening. 
 What's really holding the  Airpods  back in this area is their design; because 
 these headphones are made of hard plastic, they don't create as tight of 
 a seal as gummy-tipped earbuds.&nbsp; 
 That last part became abundantly 
 clear after testing the  Jaybird RUNs , which do have a gummy-tipped design, 
 better seal, and tighter bass. That said, the  Jaybird RUNs  don't sound 
 as good as the Airpods do overall; their treble was too jacked up to enjoy 
 certain guitar-heavy music for extended periods of time. This wasn't a deal 
 breaker thanks to some EQ settings I discovered during my testing, but these 
 earbuds still sounded less accurate&nbsp;overall. 
   Winner: Apple's Airpods 
    
   Design: The Airpods are more beautiful, but the RUNs are more functional. 
 
  Jaybird 
  If I were judging design by aesthetics alone, the winner would 
 be clear. But design is how something works, not just how it looks.&nbsp; 
 
  The Airpods  have a really great look. Their single-color, button-free 
 design screams simplicity, and it's hard not to take a second to appreciate 
 it every once in a while. But that same simplicity comes with a cost: usability. 
 There's no way to really turn the  Airpods  off besides putting them in 
 their charging case or disconnecting them through the Bluetooth settings 
 on your phone. 
 Additionally, the only way you can interact with the Airpods 
 is by double tapping on one of the buds to summon Siri or perform simple 
 media functions: play, pause, next track, previous track.&nbsp;The system 
 works most of time time, but it's a little awkward to do and occasionally 
 fails. 
 On the other hand, the  Jaybird RUNs  look a lot more "gadgety" 
 but are ultimately a lot more functional. Each earbud has a physical button 
 you press to perform an action, which works every time you do it. You can 
 also hold the button on the right earbud to turn the  Jaybird RUNs  off. 
 It's that type of sheer usefulness that's earned Jaybird its win in this 
 category. 
   Winner: Jaybird's RUNs    
   Connectivity: The Airpods and 
 Jaybird RUNs both pair easily and stay connected. 
  Business Insider / 
 Brandt Ranj 
  Though I 100% expected I would, I didn't experience a single 
 connectivity issue with either the  Airpods  or  Jaybird RUNs  during my 
 testing. In each case, connectivity was rock solid, with no latency between 
 either pair pf earbuds and my phone. I don't have much more to say about 
 this other than that it's kind of incredible to me that wireless tech has 
 come this far. 
  Winner: A tie between the  Airpods  and  RUNs

 3 key steps Trump should take before meeting with Kim Jong Un

  Experts are divided about the wisdom 
 of President Trump's decisions to meet with North Korean dictator Kim Jong 
 Un.  
  To prepare, Trump should follow an intensive three-fold preparation 
 plan.  
  First, lower-level officials in the US should try to figure out 
 Pyongyang's intentions by meeting with their North Korean counterparts. 
  
  Second, the US should consult extensively with other Asian countries. 
  
  Third, the US should deliberate internally to determine what exactly 
 the US wishes to achieve through this meeting.  
 
 
 &nbsp; 
 President 
 Donald Trump's unexpected decision to meet with North Korean dictator Kim 
 Jong Un has elicited sharply divided responses. The White House has presented 
 the proposed summit as a diplomatic coup, while advocates of engagement 
 have greeted it with guarded relief. Skeptics have described it as naive 
 at best, given Kim's atrocious record of abuses, and a disgrace at worst. 
 Yet history will judge the meeting by a simpler metric &mdash; whether it 
 succeeds.    See the rest of the story at Business Insider   NOW WATCH:

 A column from 1999 went viral because its predictions are dead-on.  
  You 
 have to read it to believe it.   
 
 
 An 18-year-old magazine column went 
 viral over the past week because it's just so good. The column effectively 
 predicts the iPhone, Siri, and even Facebook's privacy scandals ? all the 
 way back in 1999. 
 The prediction was made by  science fiction author David 
 Gerrold , who writes novels and used to write for " Star Trek ." It was 
 shared this week by  technology writer Esther Schindler . It was published 
 in a now-defunct magazine called Smart Reseller,  according to Fast Company 
 .

 What makes this so special 
 is that not only did Gerrold foresee smartphones, but he also clearly saw 
 the privacy issues that have come with them.  
 If there's one quibble with 
 the prescient column, it's that voice assistants ? whether Apple's Siri, 
 Google's Assistant, or Amazon's Alexa ? can't really do complicated queries 
 the way Gerrold predicted. But maybe the prediction is still ahead of its 
 time.    SEE ALSO:&nbsp; Facebook employees are in disbelief that a bombshell

 the online retailer has unfair advantages and is putting traditional companies 
 out of business.  
  Trump talks about Amazon like he talks about the foreign 
 trade partners, and he may want to start a domestic version of a trade war. 
  
  But Amazon is the best-liked large company in America and will be a 
 tough enemy.  
 
 
  The most obvious explanation for President Donald Trump's 
 antipathy for Amazon &mdash; and, I'm sure, one of the main contributing 
 factors &mdash; is that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post, 
 which Trump hates. 
 But there must be more to it than that. 
 After all, 
 Trump talks about Amazon and Bezos much more than he talks about Carlos 
 Slim, the Mexican telecom billionaire who owns a large stake in The New 
 York Times, which he also hates. 
 Axios  reported  this week that  Trump 
 is "obsessed" with Amazon , and it offers several reasons for his obsession 
 that go far beyond a personal feud. Read the list, and Trump's obsession 
 with Amazon makes sense &mdash; because it dovetails with his populist, 
 protectionist and nostalgic view of the broader economy. 
 Amazon is all 
 about change, and not the kind of change Trump likes. 
  With Trump, look 
 for the real-estate angle  
  "His real estate buddies tell him &mdash; 
 and he agrees &mdash; that Amazon is killing shopping malls and brick-and-mortar 
 retailers," Axios reports.  
 This objection aligns with Trump's views on 
 trade:&nbsp; He's more focused on protecting old industries than fostering 
 new ones.  
  Trump is not moved by the idea that cheap imported steel is 
 good for Americans who buy steel products, or for American companies that 
 make products out of steel. He worries about the loss of steel mills that 
 are, or were, job anchors in certain Rust Belt communities.  
  It doesn't 
 hurt that Trump has friends with relevant business interests that would 
 benefit from the protection of the status quo, whether those are ownership 
 stakes in steel mills or shopping malls.  
 There is also a community aspect 
 to resistance to Amazon. In a time where people are less likely to go to 
 church or participate in bowling leagues, Amazon is contributing to the 
 loss of some of the remaining public spaces where Americans gather with 
 their neighbors: malls. 
  Maybe Trump isn't nostalgic for hanging out at 
 the mall. But the nostalgic desire he's expressing here, of wanting to keep 
 communities the way they once were, with a steel mill to work in and a mall 
 to shop at, clearly resonates with a slice of the electorate.  
  Trump 
 is obsessed with who's cheating  
     
  There's another echo of the tariffs 
 fight: Trump is convinced that Amazon must be gaining its advantage in the 
 retail sector by cheating.  
  Trump  says Amazon is getting a free ride 
  from the US Postal Service, even though this is no more true than his claim 
 that Canada has a trade surplus with the US.  
  In fact, the post office 
 makes a lot of money delivering Amazon's packages&nbsp;&mdash; for now, 
 at least, though we'll see what happens as Amazon expands  its in-house 
 airline .  
  But again, as on trade, not all of Trump's accusations are 
 wrong. He says Amazon skirts state and local taxes, which is quite true: 
 After years of resistance, Amazon collects sales tax on its own sales, but 
 not necessarily on sales by marketplace sellers using their platform.  
 
  If I were Trump, I'd raise another form of cheating that he hasn't publicly 
 discussed yet. It's called showrooming: when customers check out products 
 in physical stores, where a brick and mortar retailer pays the bill to keep 
 the lights on, and then they order online, where the price is lowest.  
 
  You can't make money running a showroom, and as brick and mortar stores 
 close, jobs and tax revenue are getting lost &mdash; and even Amazon customers 
 are losing something, in the form of a convenient place to check out products. 
  
  Trump is scrambling usual left-right alignments on the economy  
  In 
 some areas, especially tax policy, Trump has spoken populist rhetoric and 
 then gone along with Republican policy orthodoxy. 
 But in other cases, 
 he's shown a willingness to break with Republicans and push a policy that 
 aims to slow the pace of economic change, even over the objections of corporate 
 interests. 
 The most obvious example of that is his tariff policy. But 
 another example is his Justice Department's choice to object to the AT&amp;T-Time 
 Warner merger, after Republicans have spent decades pushing for more lax 
 antitrust enforcement. 
 As with Amazon, in the AT&amp;T-Time Warner case 
 it's tough to tell where Trump's personal vendettas end and his policy interests 
 begin.&nbsp; Trump has complained bitterly about coverage from Time Warner 
 subsidiary CNN.* But there is also a valid policy argument that companies 
 that own both cable channels and cable wires have excessive power over pricing, 
 and that blocking such a merger is a good use of anti-trust power&nbsp;&mdash; 
 even if it's an argument you'd usually hear from the left side of the aisle. 
  
 Trump isn't the first person to raise concerns about online retail, but 
 once again it's unusual to hear them from a Republican. Usually, it's people 
 on the left who emphasize the need for metrics other than prices and profit 
 margins when deciding whether economic changes like the ones Amazon drives 
 are good. 
 (A liberal critic of Amazon would probably also raise concerns 
 about pay and labor conditions at Amazon's warehouses, but I wouldn't hold 
 my breath for Trump to discuss this.) 
  Trump will take on companies that 
 bug him, but Amazon can bite back  
 If I were Trump I'd be afraid to go 
 to war with Amazon, because Amazon is very popular. 
 Each year, the Harris 
 Poll conducts its &nbsp;  "Reputation Quotient" study , examining public 
 opinion on the 100 most visible companies in America. In 2018, Harris found 
 Amazon had the most positive public image out of all 100 companies.&nbsp; 
 
 AT&amp;T was 70th, and Time Warner was 81st, probably because people still 
 think Time Warner owns Time Warner Cable. 
 It's not surprising Amazon is 
 so popular. Amazon improves convenience, choice and value for consumers, 
 offering them two-day delivery on an immense variety of well-priced products. 
 People like that. 
 Lots of people talk a good game about supporting mom-and-pop 
 retail and wanting their communities to stay the way they once were, but 
 in practice, they're busy and they like having products cheaply and reliably 
 delivered to their door. 
  Trump's nostalgia does not always align with 
 the public's  
     
 There are some things for which people really are 
 nostalgic. People have a sense that medium-skilled industrial jobs at big 
 factories used to hold communities together, and that after those plants 
 closed, communities hurt in ways both economic and social. 
 But are people 
 really nostalgic for the old ways of retail? Do they miss the experience 
 of having to leave home to shop, and do they feel the mostly low-paying 
 jobs in those stores were the backbone of their communities? 
 Do they feel 
 that nostalgia if none of their friends own commercial real estate? 
 People's 
 individual shopping behaviors say no, they do not. They like shopping at 
 Amazon. And if the Harris Poll is to be believed, they like it a lot. 
 
 And since Trump is quite unpopular, he may not want an enemy as popular 
 as Amazon.

 The Galaxy S9 has 11 great features buried in the settings you should check 
 out
summary: 
text1:  
 Android phones can be customized way more than iPhones, and Samsung adds 
 its own little touches that take customization to another level.  
 The 
 thing is, Samsung rarely mentions these cool little features when it announces 
 its new phones, and they can go unnoticed for your entire ownership of a 
 Samsung phone.  
 Many of the features mentioned here aren't exclusive to 
 Samsung's new phone, the Galaxy S9. You'll find most of them in previous 
 models, too, but I added them to the list just in case you missed them.  
 
  Check out 11 cool tips and tricks for your Galaxy S9 :   SEE ALSO:&nbsp; 
 Samsung is making some good-looking cases for your new ? fragile ? Galaxy 
 S9   
 1. Make the screen even sharper. 
 
  Out of the box, the Galaxy 
 S9's screen is set to 1080p. That's somewhat odd considering the display's 
 native resolution is a sharper 1440p. 
 You can set the phone to make full 
 use of its sharp display by heading to&nbsp; Settings &gt; Display &gt; 
 Screen resolution,&nbsp; then set it from FHD+ to WQHD+. 
 Setting the display 
 to a higher resolution means you'll take a small hit on battery life, but 
 it's not a dramatic difference by any means. The sharpness difference isn't 
 massive, but it's there, and you get the full effect of Samsung's smartphone 
 displays that are the best in the business.&nbsp;  
   2. Make the screen 
 less harsh-looking at night time. 
 
  Many phones have this feature now. 
 Apple calls it Night Shift, Samsung calls it Blue Light Filter. It basically 
 reduces the intensity of bright blue colors that can appear overly bright 
 and keep your brain awake when you're trying to wind down around night time. 
 
 Head to&nbsp; Settings &gt; Display &gt; Blue light filter &gt; Turn on 
 as scheduled.&nbsp; You can set it for the default sunset to sunrise, or 
 set the feature to run during your own custom times.&nbsp;  
   3. Squeeze 
 more apps onto your home screen. 
 
  By default, the Galaxy S9's home screen 
 positions its apps pretty far apart from each other, and it doesn't give 
 you much control of where you want the app icons to go.&nbsp; 
 Head to&nbsp; 
 Settings &gt; Display &gt; Home screen &gt; Home screen grid . There, you 
 can set it to show more apps that you can position closer together.&nbsp;

 Key Words: Trump tweets dial up attack on Amazon and the ?lobbyist? and ?fake? 
 Washington Post
summary: 
text1:  
 Two days after introducing the topic with a Thursday tweet saying the e-commerce 
 giant was using the U.S. Postal Service as a delivery boy, President Trump 
 renewed his attack on Amazon.com?s business practices with a brace of tweets 
 early Saturday, while also opening himself up to speculation that his ill 
 will toward the company is as much about coverage of his administration 
 by the Washington Post, owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, as it is about 
 postal-service fees and sales-tax remittance.

 7 ways millennials' lives are no different than their parents' at their age
summary: 
text1:   
 Scharfsinn/Shutterstock.com    
 
   Millennials &nbsp;are generally defined 
 as people born from 1981 and 1996.  
  While many aspects of life have changed 
 since their parents were young, others have stayed exactly the same.  
 
  For example, attitudes around gender roles have barely budged and young 
 people are still seeking meaningful work beyond a paycheck.  
 
 
  You 
 could reasonably argue that  millennials  &mdash; the generation born between 
 1981 and 1996 &mdash;  have it easier  than those before them. 
 You could 
 also reasonably argue that they  have it worse . 
 It's not quite as catchy 
 to talk about all the ways that life has, well, stagnated. But in many ways, 
 research suggests, life is largely the same as it was 30 years ago. 
 Young 
 people are still job-hopping, everyone's still calling them selfish, and 
 there's&nbsp; still&nbsp; no magic bullet for finding love. Read on for 
 some of the biggest commonalities between millennials and their parents. 
  It's still hard for young people to find love 
  Bogdan Sonjachnyj/Shutterstock.com 
 
  Which is harder: Choosing from thousands of Tinder profiles or choosing 
 from a smaller pool of classmates, coworkers, and friends? 
 Trick question: 
 They can both be pretty awful. 
 As Mandy Ginsberg, CEO of Match Group North 
 America,  previously told Business Insider , no matter what medium you use 
 to meet people, you're still going to face the same challenges finding a 
 relationship.&nbsp; 
 That is to say, Baby Boomers and Generation X probably 
 didn't have an easier or harder time dating than Millennials. People have 
 always been flaky, and clingy, and just plain mean &mdash; and they will 
 be for the foreseeable future.  
   Young people are still job-hopping 
 
  Strelka Institute/Flickr 
  Millennials have gotten a rap for treating 
 the job market like a game of leap frog. This is pretty undeserved: Young 
 professionals have always been more inclined to switch jobs than older workers. 
 
 As Ben Casselman points out on  FiveThirtyEight , job tenure for Americans 
 in their 20s is roughly the same today as it was in the 1980s, according 
 to data from the  Bureau of Labor Statistics . 
 In fact,  Casselman notes 
  that millennials are actually changing jobs slightly  less  often than 
 their predecessors. That suggests they probably aren't moving around enough, 
 given that changing jobs can be a way to both earn more money and find the 
 best fit.  
   Many young men still struggle with the concept of gender 
 equality 
  Ethan/Flickr 
  Young people's attitudes around gender equality 
 have shifted &mdash; but not in the direction you might think. 
 A&nbsp; 
 2017 report  from the Council on Contemporary Families found that young 
 adults ages 18 to 25 have grown only slightly more supportive of gender 
 equality in the home since the mid-70s and slightly  less  supportive since 
 the mid-90s. 
 Consider: In 1977, approximately 45%&nbsp;of men ages 18 
 to 25 disagreed with the notion that the man should be the breadwinner and 
 the woman should be the homemaker. In 1994, it was 83%. In 2014, only 55% 
 disagreed. 
 Other reports suggest that millennial men do support gender 
 equality in the home, but they have a hard time putting those beliefs into 
 action. An article in&nbsp; The New York Times &nbsp;reads: 
 "Millennial 
 men &mdash; ages 18 to early 30s &mdash; have much more egalitarian attitudes 
 about family, career and gender roles inside marriage than generations before 
 them, according to a variety of research by social scientists. Yet they 
 struggle to achieve their goals once they start families, researchers say." 
 
 That's possibly because of a relative lack of&nbsp; family-friendly policies 
 &nbsp;in the American workplace.

 Vermont Legislature Passes Sweeping Gun Restrictions
summary: 
text1:   
 Lawmakers in Vermont, a place long steeped in hunting culture, on Friday 
 approved a sweeping package of new gun restrictions, making the state all 
 but certain to join Florida in passing a raft of new gun control measures 
 after a teenage gunman killed 17 people last month at a high school in Parkland, 
 Fla. Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican, has vowed to sign the measure. It represents 
 a remarkable departure from the state&#x92;s existing gun laws, which are 
 some of the weakest in the country &#x97; and an about-face for Mr. Scott, 
 who decided to consider new gun control measures...

 I spend half of my income on food and drink ? here's what I spend in a week
summary: 
text1:   
 Joana Lopes/Shutterstock    
 
  I regularly spend $800 per week on food 
 and drink, about half my income.   
  Living in Seattle gives me access 
 to great markets and restaurants; food is my greatest passion.  
  I'm remaining 
 anonymous for privacy reasons.  
 
 
  I know, I know.  I spend way too 
 much on food and going out. The thing is, I love food, live alone, and work 
 from home, so I need few excuses to entertain or go out. This social being 
 needs human interaction &mdash; preferably over food and drink. 
 I live 
 in Seattle and make $1,640 weekly, pretax. I freelance on the side, but 
 that income varies greatly. The rent for my one-bedroom apartment is $1,425 
 a month, plus utilities. Other monthly expenses include my dog ($100), Pilates 
 ($160), cellphone ($80), internet ($80), and occasional travel. 
 I steer 
 clear of caffeine, so I don&rsquo;t have a daily Starbucks fix. Water is 
 my beverage of choice, sometimes carbonated courtesy of my SodaStream. Booze 
 is my runner-up, and I admittedly spend big money to drink well. 
 I got 
 rid of my wheels several years ago, and my company provides a transit pass, 
 so I don&rsquo;t have to worry about that expense. Also, I&rsquo;m not a 
 big shopper, nor into acquiring &ldquo;stuff,&rdquo; so my retail expenses 
 are minimal. 
 A big chunk of my income goes to shared experiences, so what 
 my savings lacks in zeros my quality of life makes up for in spades.&nbsp;Here&rsquo;s 
 what I spend on food, drinks, groceries, and dining out in a typical week. 
 Totals include 9.6% sales tax where applicable.  Friday

   Breakfast  
  I have a work hard/play hard attitude toward life. I don&rsquo;t 
 diet, but try to squeeze in healthy meals where I can. The Green Dream smoothie 
 at    PCC Natural Markets    ($5.99), the community co-op that&rsquo;s one 
 block from my apartment, gives me the energy boost I need to start the day. 
  
  (Total: $6.57)  
  Lunch  
  I don&rsquo;t work until 1 p.m. on Fridays, 
 so I&rsquo;ll frequently take myself out for lunch before starting my shift. 
 One of my favorite go-tos is the Columbia City Ale House. Their Reuben ($14.95) 
 is to die for, especially when paired with one of the brew pub&rsquo;s many 
 selections. I&rsquo;m partial to the Hales Kolsch ($6.75).  
  Total (with 
 $5.00 tip): = $28.89  
  Groceries  
  I made a post-work repeat appearance 
 at PCC to pick up beer and fruit garnishes for cocktails for the weekend. 
 Think: Negronis, my cocktail of choice.  
  12-pack of Aslan Light Lager 
 ($19.50), organic Meyer lemon ($1.30), organic heirloom orange ($1.17), 
 organic Anjou pear ($1.91)  
  Total: $23.88  
  Dinner  
  My boyfriend 
 came over and we decided to check out the neighborhood newcomer, Bua 9 Thai. 
 We ordered take-out gyoza, Pad Thai, and a luscious green curry with chicken 
 that didn&rsquo;t disappoint.  
  Total (with $5.00 tip): $37.50   
   Saturday

   Brunch  
  I had a bunch of freelance 
 work on my plate for the day, but a dear friend had just returned from a 
 work trip to Thailand and had eschewed yoga in lieu of day drinking. We 
 met at Super Six for brunch, where I indulged in the &ldquo;Big Blue&rdquo; 
 Benny ($14) and a Super Michelada ($6).   
  Total (with $5.00 tip): $26.92 
  
  Dinner  
  Still full from brunch, I decided to go light for dinner 
 and hit the salad bar, at yep, you guessed it, PCC. (I jokingly refer to 
 it as my pantry, since it&rsquo;s commonly a three times a day habit.)  
 
  Total: $8.99   
   Sunday 
  Ben Gilbert/Business Insider 
   Brunch 
  
  It&rsquo;s a known fact that I make the best breakfast sandwich on the 
 planet. It costs waaay more than an Egg McMuffin, but is seriously so darn 
 delicious. My boyfriend regularly comes over to indulge in breakfast sandwich 
 brunch, complete with mimosas.  
  English muffins ($3.19), eggs ($3.89), 
 Tillamook cheddar cheese ($5.99), arugula ($3.99), Mama Lil&rsquo;s peppers 
 ($7.99), Karam&rsquo;s Original garlic sauce ($12.99), pound of black forest 
 bacon ($7.99), two bottles of Prosecco (2 at $10 = $20), organic grapefruit 
 juice ($7.99)  
  Total: $82.19  
  Lunch  
  I unapologetically love cheese. 
 And although I love the Pacific Northwest, not a day goes by when I don&rsquo;t 
 long for the heirloom tomatoes I had living on the Central Coast of California. 
 Whenever I can get my hands on a good-enough tomato, I turn into a caprese 
 salad. So simple, so good.  
  Heirloom tomatoes ($6.82), whole milk mozzarella 
 ($5.99) and basil ($4.99)  
  (I had olive oil and balsamic vinegar on hand) 
  
  Total: $19.51  
  Dinner  
  Chef Joel DeBilzan puts together themed 
 Sunday feasts at Seafood Feast at Tavol&agrave;ta. The Seafood Feast was 
 off-the-hook featuring all of the Pacific Northwest&rsquo;s finest from 
 spot prawns to King salmon, Total knockout of an 11-course tasting menu! 
  
  $120.00 + Manhattan ($11), glass of La Spinetta Vermentino ($15) + 20%

 The second blue moon of 2018 is about to arrive ? here's what that means

summary:

 Shutterstock    
 
  On March 31, much of the world will get to see the second 
 blue moon of the year, making this a rare double-blue moon year.  
  That's 
 according to a newer definition of the term "blue moon" &mdash; it would 
 be impossible under an older definition.  
  But both definitions allow 
 for "blue moons" every two to three years. There's another rarer kind of 
 blue moon, however &mdash; but that one has to do with volcanoes and fires. 
  
 
 
 On March 31, much of the world will get to see a rare event: A second 
 blue moon in one year. It'll be the second blue moon of 2018 &mdash; at 
 least, according to one definition of the term. 
 Despite the name, as many 
 of us have learned at some point (often in a disappointing fashion, if we 
 learned this as a kid) a blue moon doesn't mean the moon turns blue. The 
 term refers to frequency, not color.    See the rest of the story at Business

 Mo Salah earns Liverpool victory as Sadio Mané courts controversy
summary: 
text1:  
 It was a frantic and contentious contest and ultimately one of huge satisfaction 
 for Liverpool as they recovered from going 1-0 down to secure a victory 
 that shores up their place in the Premier League top four and provides ideal 
 preparation ahead of Wednesday?s Champions League contest with Manchester 
 City.  To nobody?s great surprise, it was Mohamed Salah who struck Liverpool?s 
 later winner, a calm and precise finish from Andy Robertson?s cross on 84 
 minutes that took the Egyptian?s tally to 39 goals in what continues to 
 be a remarkable debut season. In the broader sense for the visitors, this 
 triumph displayed their capacity to carve out a win even when they are not 
 playing well, which was the case here, and will only deepen Crystal Palace?s 
 sense of regret after they had taken the lead through Luka Milivojevic?s 
 13 minute penalty.   Continue reading...

  Obamacare premiums increased between 
 2017 and 2018, according to a new study.  
  The average cost of the cheapest 
 silver-tier plan increased 32% across the US. Gold-tier plans saw a 19.1% 
 increase.  
  There were a variety of reasons for the increases, from Trump 
 administration changes to marketplace fundamentals.  
  Check out the increases 
 for silver and gold plans by state in maps below.  
 
 
 Affordable Care 
 Act premiums are headed in the same direction as last year: higher. 
 According 
 to  a new study  from the Urban Institute and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 
 premiums in the Obamacare exchanges &mdash; which provide insurance for 
 people who do not get coverage through work or a government program like 
 Medicaid &mdash; jumped 32% nationally for the lowest-cost silver-tier plan, 
 as well as 19.1% for gold-tier plans.    See the rest of the story at Business

 Here's how the Toys R Us sweepstakes is shaping up
summary:

 Getty/Jack Taylor    
 
  Target stands out as a likely winner, as many of 
 its stores are in close proximity to Toys R Us stores.  
  Don't count out 
 Walmart, for the same reason.  
  And never count out Amazon.  
 
 
 Toys 
 R Us is going out of business, liquidating its inventory, and planning to 
 sell its 800 storefronts in the U.S. and U.K. In a fiercely competitive 
 retail industry with one-stop shops like &nbsp;  Walmart  &nbsp;  ( NYSE:WMT 
 ) , &nbsp;  Target  &nbsp;  ( NYSE:TGT ) , and &nbsp;  Amazon  &nbsp;  ( 
 NASDAQ:AMZN ) , Toys R Us couldn't keep up. In fact, it says those three 
 are to blame for its decision earlier this month to completely shut down 
 the business, after the bigger retailers ruthlessly slashed toy prices at 
 their stores during the holiday season. 
 Of course, that was a strategic 
 move by those three, as each stands to gain when one of the largest toy 
 stores in the country shuts down and abandons its storefronts.    See the

 The most popular tourist attraction in every state
summary:

  TripAdvisor and MONEY have identified 
 the most popular and highest-rated tourist attractions in each American 
 state.   
  While landmarks and museums tend to draw the biggest crowds, 
 recent years have seen locally guided trips &mdash; such as brewery tours 
 &mdash; rising in popularity.&nbsp;  
  Each American state offers something 
 different, from snorkeling in Hawaii to ballooning in New Mexico.&nbsp; 
  
 
 
 Whether you've planned a trip or you're making a pit stop on a long 
 drive, a new city has a lot to offer. Between museums, city landmarks and 
 national parks, each U.S. state has its own culture and history tourists 
 can learn from. 
 That's why MONEY worked with TripAdvisor to identify the 
 most popular tourist activity in every state. Their data revealed that while 
 landmarks and museums remains most popular attraction for newcomers, tours 
 and trips that reveal something about a particular region's culture &mdash; 
 whether it be a living history museum or a brewery bus tour &mdash; often 
 outdraw the cultural landmarks. 
 To come up with the data, TripAdvisor 
 looked at on-site bookings for attractions, tours and activities for all 
 of 2017, and picked the most popular. For the seven states that did not 
 have enough data for TripAdvisor to analyze &mdash; Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, 
 Mississippi, Nebraska, North Dakota, and Oklahoma &mdash; MONEY subbed in 
 TripAdvisor's highest-rated thing to do. 
 Here are the most popular tourist 
 activities in each state:  Alabama ? Tour of Mobile 
  Sean Pavone/Shutterstock 
 
   Cost per adult ticket:   $29  
 The port in Alabama's historic city, 
 Mobile, played a key role in trading between France and Spain. The most 
 popular way to experience the port is through an tour run by Gulf Coast 
 Ducks, which cost $26 for adults, $16 for kids and $10 for infants.  
  
  Alaska ? Kenai Fjords Wildlife Cruise

  Cost per adult ticket:   $98  
 See Alaskan wildlife &mdash; 
 including whales, sea lions and puffins &mdash; up close on the most popular 
 cruise in Alaska. The five-hour trip starts at noon and covers 55 miles 
 of sea around Kenai Fjords National Park.  
   Arizona ? Sedona-Grand Canyon 
 Day Trip 
  prochasson frederic/Shutterstock 
   Cost per adult ticket: 
   $179.29  
 The Grand Canyon is easily Arizona's most visited site, but 
 guided tours from Sedona are the most popular way travelers elect to explore 
 the park. The trip promises tourists in-depth knowledge on the area's history, 
 and includes stops at the Painted Desert and Little Colorado River Gorge.

 The stock research business is getting battered in 2018 ? and it's especially 
 bleak for one type of firm
summary:

 Spencer Platt/Getty Images    
 
  Equity research firms have seen revenue 
 slashed in 2018, with some experiencing drops of as much as 60%.  
  The 
 catalyst for the decline is sweeping European financial reform that went 
 into effect January 3. Though the rules originated in Europe, they're having 
 a global impact.  
  For global banks, where research isn't a profit center, 
 falling revenue isn't a giant concern &mdash; at least not yet.  
  For 
 struggling specialist and domestic firms without diversified revenue streams, 
 the decline poses a more existential threat.  
  Some boutiques have capitalized 
 on the new environment and have outperformed top-tier banks.  
 
 
 Some 
 of the top equity-research shops in the world have seen revenue decline 
 by 10% to 30% this year &mdash; and those are the lucky ones. 
 Others are 
 staring at declines of as much as 60%, according to figures from the consulting 
 firm Oliver Wyman.    See the rest of the story at Business Insider   NOW

 Meet the kids of the world's richest billionaire business moguls

  Many of the world's  richest people  and most 
 recognizable business moguls are also parents.   
  They raise their kids 
 just like everyone else, but with billions of dollars to do so.  
  Education 
 is usually a priority: Bill Gates sent his children to the private school 
 he graduated from, and   Elon Musk's five sons attend a secret school founded 
 by their father.  
 
 
  Most kids face the same problems growing up, but 
 some do so with a  billionaire  parent. 
 When not running their tech company 
 and managing other executives, many of the  world's richest  people and 
 most recognizable business moguls have the universal job of taking care 
 of their children. 
 The kids of the richest business moguls have many of 
 the same experiences as everyone else. They go to school, relax on vacation, 
 date, and eventually have children and careers of their own.&nbsp; 
 However, 
 they may also attend secret schools, pursue expensive hobbies like riding 
 horses, or head up their father's charity organization &mdash; less than 
 ordinary experiences that make their childhood the opposite of average.&nbsp; 
 
 Below, find out more about the children of some of the most successful 
 billionaire business moguls:  Mark Cuban ,  Mark Zuckerberg ,&nbsp; Elon 
 Musk ,&nbsp; Richard Branson ,&nbsp; Bill Gates , and&nbsp; Warren Buffett 
 .&nbsp;  Mark Cuban is a father to three children ? Alexis, Alyssa, and 
 Jake.

   Cuban and his wife, Tiffany, keep family time fun. Last summer, the 
 Cuban family took a vacation to Disneyland.

 &nbsp;  
   Cuban has admitted that it is difficult to get 
 his children off their phones. He limits Netflix time for his kids and has 
 instituted a technology curfew.

 Tim Shaffer/Reuters    
 
  A shortage of truck drivers in the US has increased 
 their wages, on average.  
  Unlike many other industries, trucking companies 
 have been able to pass on these higher costs to their clients through higher 
 prices.&nbsp;  
  But in most other industries, including those getting 
 crushed by higher freight costs, it's not as easy to raise prices.&nbsp; 
  
 
 
 There aren't enough truck drivers in the US to meet the demand for 
 freighting services.&nbsp; 
 One outcome of this is that truck drivers, 
 on average, are getting paid more. The median salary for a truckload driver 
 working a national, irregular route has risen by 15% since 2013, a  survey 
  from the&nbsp;American Trucking Association, a trade group, showed.&nbsp;

 Are you a citizen of the United States? It seems like a simple enough question. 
 But the Trump administration&#x92;s plan to add it to the 2020 census has 
 caused a firestorm of protest. A multi-state lawsuit, led by New York&#x92;s 
 Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, is being brought to prevent the question 
 from appearing on the census. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra 
 has filed a separate lawsuit over the same issue. Opponents claim the citizenship 
 question will keep people from filling out the census, especially those 
 not legally residing in the U.S. As Schneiderman put it in a release, the

 NFL POWER RANKINGS: Where all 32 teams stand in the middle of a chaotic offseason
summary: 
text1:   
 AP Photo/Tony Avelar    
 Football season never ends. 
 It might feel like 
 a few weeks ago the Philadelphia Eagles were walking into the sunset with 
 their first Super Bowl victory in franchise history. But teams are already 
 loading up in the NFL offseason to get themselves ready for the 2018 Draft 
 and hopefully a run at next year's Super Bowl. 
 We've already seen big 
 changes at quarterback across the league that will shape the season to come 
 and thus have shifted the power structure of the NFL since we left it back 
 in February. 
 Thus, we've put together an offseason Power Ranking to keep 
 track of where every team stands in the midst of a busy offseason. 
 Take 
 a look below and see where your team fits in the mix.  32. Miami Dolphins 
 
  Joe Skipper/Getty Images 
   2017 record:&nbsp; 6-10 
  Biggest additions:&nbsp; 
  Signed RB Frank Gore, signed QB Brock Osweiler  
  Biggest losses:  DT&nbsp;Ndamukong 
 Suh,&nbsp;LB Lawrence Timmons 
  One thing to know:  The most significant 
 determining factor for the Dolphins chances in 2018 is the return of Ryan 
 Tannehill, but from the looks of their offseason so far, they'll have a 
 long year ahead of them.  
   31. Cincinnati Bengals 
  Patrick Semansky/AP 
 
   2017 record:  7-9, 3rd in AFC North 
  Biggest additions:  Signed LB 
 Preston Brown, traded for LT Cordy Glenn 
  Biggest losses:  QB A.J. McCarron, 
 CB Adam Jones, RB Jeremy Hill 
  One thing to know: &nbsp;In trading for 
 Cordy Glenn, the Bengals hope their improved offensive line will give Andy 
 Dalton more time in the pocket and create better holes for second-year running 
 back Joe Mixon.  
   30. Indianapolis Colts 
  Jonathan Ferrey/Getty 
  
  2017 record:&nbsp; 4-12 
  Biggest additions:&nbsp; Signed TE Eric Ebron, 
 hired Frank Reich as head coach 
  Biggest losses:&nbsp; DT Johnathan Hankins 
 
  One thing to know:  The Colts offseason included a false alarm of a head 
 coach announcement, with  Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels 
 agreeing to take the position before reneging on the deal at the 11th hour 
 . Frank Reich will lead the Colts in his stead, with Andrew Luck hopefully 
 back and healthy after missing the entire 2017 season.

 The Tesla story is under pressure ? and it should worry investors (TSLA)
summary: 
text1:  
 Tesla  boosters are seeing their story tested by a deluge of negative news 
 about the company.  
  This distracts from what Tesla has actually achieved. 
  
  The company doesn't need to take over the world to be successful.  
 
 
 
  Gene Munster, a former technology analyst, now a venture capitalist, 
 thinks  Tesla  will take over the world.&nbsp; 
 But  on the heels of a 
 recall  last week, along with some other negative news, Munster admits that 
 his patience is being tested. 
  "[D]o we still believe in the story?" he 
 asks in a  research post on the Loup Ventures site .&nbsp;&nbsp;  "The answer 
 is yes. Our support is based on a view that the company is uniquely positioned 
 to capitalize on a dramatic shift in auto (computer on wheels), innovate 
 in both EV and autonomy, and usher in a new paradigm of manufacturing efficiencies." 
  
  This is, of course, wrong. Tesla isn't anymore uniquely positioned than 
 Waymo and Jaguar, which announced a self-driving-vehicle partnership last 
 week, or General Motors, which has been selling thousands of all-electric 
 Chevy Bolts, a sub-$40,000 car that the automaker rolled out in 2016, more 
 than a year ahead of the Tesla Model 3.  
  Tesla is part of a transportation 
 ecosystem where a tremendous amount of experimentation and investment is 
 taking place. And in the grand scheme of things, Tesla is a minor player. 
 Yes, it attracts outsized buzz due to the celebrity of CEO  Elon Musk . 
 But this is a carmaker that took 15 years to break the 100,000-cars-per-year 
 production barrier.  
  Tesla is also a carmaker that fans see as both disruptive 
 and embattled, which is also wrong. A company selling 100,000 vehicles annually, 
 at an average price of $100,000, isn't disrupting anything. Rather, it's 
 adding to the mix of luxury vehicles in the market.   
  Nor is Tesla under 
 assault by competitors. In fact, the rest of the auto industry &mdash; contrary 
 to what Musk often says about traditional companies wanting to kill Tesla 
 off &mdash; is happy to watch Tesla take all the risks involved with electric 
 vehicles and admires the emergence of a brave, new brand.  
  Concocting 
 a story that doesn't match reality  
     
  Tesla enthusiasts such as Munster, 
 however, find themselves in a weird position. Profitability has long been 
 a measure of success in the auto industry, which is hugely capital-intensive. 
 But Tesla has never really made any money. Growth in the car business is 
 determined by sales, but with the exception of China, sales growth is constrained 
 in most markets. But Munster thinks Tesla could be selling 11 million cars 
 a year in just the US, a 65% share in a market where the biggest company, 
 GM, now has less than 20%.  
  Consequently, Tesla boosters have concocted 
 a story that entails a radical remaking of mobility and how we relate to 
 automobiles. This goes miles beyond Tesla commercializing a propulsion technology 
 that's been around for over a century. I'd even wager that to call it a 
 "story" is quaintly misdirected. At the extremes, it's a fantasy.  
 A lucrative 
 fantasy, as it turns out. Even with Tesla's stock swoon of the past month, 
 down close to 30%, if you'd bought after the 2010 IPO, you'd still be sitting 
 on a nearly 900% return. For eight years, Tesla has been a great way to 
 trade to the future. 
 It is worth it to know when a fantasy or a story 
 is colliding with reality and becoming something else. From Tesla's point 
 of view, the cars aren't even the full tale: ever since late 2016, when 
 Tesla acquired SolarCity, the firm has been a holding company with an integrated 
 vision about sustainable energy. Electric cars are just one piece of that 
 strategy. 
 But for the moment, Tesla is still overwhelmingly a car company 
 because that's where the money is being brought and being spent. And that 
 aspect of the narrative is the one that's coming under tremendous pressure.&nbsp; 
 
 An information vacuum for investors 
   
 Why? Simple: investors have 
 nothing else to go on. It's easy to tell how Toyota and GM are faring. Just 
 look at how much money they're making, what their return in invested capital 
 is, how many assets they have, and how much cash they've stocked away to 
 weather a sales downturn.&nbsp; 
 Tesla won't even tell investors how many 
 vehicles it's selling every month &mdash; we have to wait until the close 
 of a quarter to get those numbers &mdash; and the earnings reports every 
 three months are simply opportunities to assess how much money the company 
 is losing, and to get updates on ambitious production targets that aren't 
 being met.&nbsp; 
 The cars are cool, Musk is an exciting personality, and 
 Tesla has ridden a story that's very much of Silicon Valley and its values, 
 rather than the more plodding, execution-based narrative that Detroit has 
 cranked out for decades. But ultimately, the Tesla investment narrative 
 is starved for meaningful plot points. That why Munster can have a minor 
 crisis of confidence over something as trivial as a power-steering recall 
 &mdash; a defect that a big carmaker would deal with in a month and move 
 on. 
 Actually, this is the only really unique thing about Tesla. If the 
 company beats expectations by a few thousand sales, the markets go bonkers. 
 Accidents can send the stock into a tailspin. The fundamentals are objectively 
 not very good. Lately, all anybody wants to talk about is the company's 
 financial situation, which, technically speaking, isn't that far from bankruptcy 
 (despite that, bankruptcy is unlikely, for now).&nbsp; 
 Meanwhile, there 
 are  plenty of wonderful stories coming out of Tesla  that have nothing 
 to do with computers on wheels or how seductively unique the company is. 
 The Model 3 has been a struggle, but the Model S and Model X luxury business 
 is actually pretty solid. Tesla is nowhere near what Waymo is doing with 
 self-driving tech, but its Autopilot technology is, with Cadillac's Super 
 Cruise system, the best cruise control money can buy. 
 It causes me pain 
 to see the good Tesla story subsumed by the need to push this nonsensical, 
 world-changing fantasy to ever-more-skeptical investors. Tesla has been 
 a great tale for a decade and a half. It can stay that way without taking 
 over the world.   SEE ALSO:&nbsp; Tesla's latest recall could be just the

 Many of the world's  richest people  and most recognizable business moguls 
 are also parents.   
  They raise their kids just like everyone else, but 
 with billions of dollars to do so.  
 
 Education is usually a priority: 
 Bill Gates sent his children to the private school he graduated from, and 
   Elon Musk's five sons attend a secret school founded by their father. 
 
 
 
 
  Most kids face the same problems growing up, but some do so with 
 a  billionaire  parent. 
 When not running their tech company and managing 
 other executives, many of the  world's richest  people and most recognizable 
 business moguls have the universal job of taking care of their children. 
 
 The kids of the richest business moguls have many of the same experiences 
 as everyone else. They go to school, relax on vacation, date, and eventually 
 have children and careers of their own.  
 However, they may also attend 
 secret schools, pursue expensive hobbies like riding horses, or head up 
 their father's charity organization ? less than ordinary experiences that 
 make their childhood the opposite of average.  
 Below, find out more about 
 the children of some of the most successful billionaire business moguls: 
  Mark Cuban ,  Mark Zuckerberg ,  Elon Musk ,  Richard Branson ,  Bill Gates 
 , and  Warren Buffett .    SEE ALSO:&nbsp; Meet the kids of the world's

 The West Cannibalizes Itself
summary: 
text1:   
 What civilization has ever sought to repudiate its own culture and traditions 
 as we do today? ...And of course the assault on the Western heritage from 
 within is a potent phenomenon in Europe, fostered by nearly the entire elite 
 structure of the civilization. Thus it isn&#x92;t clear what a few highly 
 accomplished intellectuals, however eloquent or anguished, can do to stem 
 the erosion of the civilizational identity. But we are witnessing the emergence 
 of some powerful political currents within the general European population, 
 manifest in increasingly populist voting patterns in France, Germany, Austria, 
 and elsewhere. Hence the Paris Statement could...

 Return of Bird of the Week: Greater Rhea

 And now for something completely different. The Greater Rhea, the signature 
 bird species of Brazil&#8217;s Cerrado and Pantanal. The Greater Rhea is 
 the western world&#8217;s largest bird, flightless and a cousin to the Ostriches 
 of Africa and the Emus of Australia. They are all Ratites, a super group 
 of large, long-legged, flightless birds. The Greater Rhea is smaller than 
 Ostriches and Emus, but at 63 inches in height, still a very impressive 
 bird. Ornithologists can match the speciation of Ratites to Gondwana&#8217;s 
 plate tectonic breakup. Geology confirmed by biology; you have to like it.

 Answers to all the biggest questions we had after Netflix's 'Wild Wild Country'
summary: 
text1:  
 Netflix   Chapman and Maclain Way&rsquo;s six-plus-hour Netflix docuseries&nbsp;Wild 
 Wild Country&nbsp;&mdash; chronicling the Rajneesh commune&rsquo;s controversial 
 and criminal efforts to overtake a rural Oregon town &mdash; is nothing 
 if not exhaustive. 
 But as anyone with an internet connection knows, there&rsquo;s 
 always more to the story. Before you start scouring the web for &nbsp;  
 everything to know  &nbsp; about Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (a.k.a. Osho), Ma 
 Anand Sheela, and the sannyasins&rsquo; five-decade saga of dynamic meditation 
 and sordid international intrigue, here are the eight biggest questions 
 that &nbsp;  Wild Wild Country  &nbsp; didn&rsquo;t answer. (Plus, a handy 
 bibliography of recommended reading and viewing if you&rsquo;d like to dive 
 into the investigation yourself.)  How did Bhagwan become a guru? 
  Netflix 
 
   Wild Wild Country &nbsp;   is far more interested in how one mystic 
 can inspire multitudes than what creates a single person&rsquo;s mystique. 
 But if you&rsquo;re curious about Bhagwan&rsquo;s biography and how he successfully 
 strung along generations of devotees during his life and postmortem, here&rsquo;s 
 some insight: He was,&nbsp;  according to one uncle  , &ldquo;headstrong&rdquo; 
 and prone to devouring library books. Further&nbsp;  Oregonian &nbsp;   
 reporting circa 1985 (see &ldquo;further reading&rdquo; bibliography below) 
 clarifies that he was raised in rural poverty by, alternately, his grandparents 
 and parents, and more or less grew to be both an expert in Eastern religions 
 and know-it-all doubter. In 1953, while attending college, he professed 
 to have had a moment of ultimate enlightenment that dovetailed with his 
 burgeoning interest in meditation and hypnosis, as well as his knack for 
 public speaking. Ostensibly, a guru was born by the time he was 21. One 
 former acquaintance told&nbsp;  Oregonian  &rsquo;s Les Zaitz that Bhagwan 
 (then known as Rajneesh) &ldquo;knew what the rich people want. They want 
 to justify their guilty consciences, to justify their guilty acts.&rdquo; 
 Fast-forward to the late 1960s &mdash; when he would encounter Sheela and 
 start planting seeds for Puna and eventually Rajneeshpuram &mdash; and Bhagwan 
 was more or less a traveling spiritual salesperson promoting a lifestyle 
 that was as much submissive as sinful. Better yet, it was largely funded 
 by &ldquo;donations&rdquo; from Western businessmen seeking an approachable 
 slice of flower power and psychedelia. It was the perfect storm from which 
 Bhagwan&rsquo;s image as lord of the hedonistic manor took unshakable hold. 
   
   What, exactly, was Bhagwan?s free-love philosophy? 
  Netflix 
  In 
 archival footage from &nbsp;  Wild Wild Country , longtime Rajneesh spokesperson 
 &nbsp;  Ma Prem Sunshine  &nbsp; (a.k.a. Sunny V. Massad) coyly suggested 
 that there simply was no single set of rules. Though in a &nbsp;  post-Rajneeshpuram 
 interview  &nbsp; with Australian journalist Howard Sattler, Bhagwan (by 
 then known as Osho) made it crystal-clear that his philosophy on monogamy 
 and sex was rooted in, apparently, teen angst. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m against 
 marriage from the very beginning,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;My parents 
 were in difficulty, my family was in difficulty, but I told them clearly 
 I am not going to be married.&rdquo; He goes on to describe a &ldquo;neurotic 
 society&rdquo; populated by couples having duty-filled sex. In &nbsp;  a 
 separate lecture  &nbsp; to his followers, Osho presents free love as a 
 way to abolish the world&rsquo;s oldest and most scandalized profession, 
 preaching that, &ldquo;if sex becomes fun, prostitutes will disappear.&rdquo; 
 He urges sannyasins to leave &ldquo;sex out of the marketplace&rdquo; and 
 suggests that &ldquo;love to be your only god&rdquo; and we all &ldquo;be 
 playful and joyous&rdquo; in the sack. That these ideals are apparently 
 only possible when sannyasins evade less optional institutions like taxation 
 and live within an outlier sovereign state paradoxically symbolized by its 
 conformity goes undiscussed. 
  
 &nbsp;  
   What about the children of 
 Rajneeshpuram? 
  Netflix 
  We learn a bit about Jane Stork&rsquo;s abandoned 
 and then &nbsp;  grievously ill son Peter  &nbsp; in &nbsp;  Wild Wild Country 
 , and other kids are caught on film or discussed in fleeting retrospect. 
 But what was it like to be raised against your will in Rajneeshpuram or 
 any out-there commune? Ask &nbsp;  Hira Bluestone , who recently &nbsp; 
  shared an account  &nbsp; of spending ages 7 to 11 alongside her dad under 
 Bhagwan&rsquo;s sway, and is penning a memoir on the experience. Bluestone 
 recalls working the land more than hitting the books, and getting lectured 
 by Stork (a.k.a. Shanti B.) for avoiding her obligations. Though when they 
 did read, it was fare like &nbsp;  this terrifying tale  &nbsp; of a girl 
 deteriorating from the effects of radiation in Hiroshima, seemingly to comfort 
 them as they counted down to nuclear holocaust. Movie night struck &nbsp; 
  a similar tone . More distressingly, there were unconfirmed allegations 
 of children &nbsp;  being sexually abused  &nbsp; on the compound. An &nbsp; 
  incredible photo set  &nbsp; by Jean-Pierre Laffont illuminates how, at 
 minimum, Rajneeshpuram was &nbsp;  like a surreal sleepaway camp  &nbsp; 
 that lasted for nearly half a decade.

 Every Steven Spielberg movie, ranked from worst to best
summary: 
text1:  
 Paramount Pictures   Spanning more than 40 years, Steven Spielberg's work&nbsp;boasts 
 an extremely diverse array&nbsp;of stories, characters, and themes. 
 He's 
 made whimsical&nbsp;fantasies&nbsp;aimed squarely at&nbsp;children ("E.T.," 
 "The Adventures of Tintin"), complex&nbsp;morality stories ("Bridge of Spies," 
 "Amistad"), and graphically violent dramas ("Munich," "Saving Private Ryan"). 
 
 For his latest, "Ready Player One," the Oscar winner returns to his popcorn 
 blockbuster roots and proves that he's still the  king of the genre . 
 
 Here we take on the difficult task of ranking from worst to best all 32 
 of Spielberg's feature-length movies.&nbsp;  32. "Indiana Jones and the 
 Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" (2008) 
  Paramount 
  Earning its rightful 
 place at the bottom of this list is the fourth entry in Spielberg's "Indiana 
 Jones" anthology. There are so many problems with this movie. If you really 
 want to understand all of them, we suggest watching Red Letter Media's in-depth 
  analysis  of why it's so bad.&nbsp;Disney announced that Spielberg and 
 star Harrison Ford will reunite for a fifth "Indy" movie. Hopefully, in 
 the words of Max Von Sydow's character in "Star Wars: The Force Awakens," 
 it "will begin to make things right."  
   31. "The Lost World: Jurassic 
 Park" (1997) 
  Universal 
  Spielberg rushed to deliver&nbsp;a sequel to 
 his 1993 record-breaking box-office smash "Jurassic Park." In the process, 
 he failed to produce a worthy successor to the groundbreaking original. 
 He also created a  scene &nbsp;in which a little girl uses gymnastics to 
 fight a dinosaur that many refer to as the worst thing he's ever done.  
 
   30. "A.I. Artificial Intelligence" (2001) 
  Warner Bros. Pictures 
 
  Stanley Kubrick originally intended to direct this project, but Spielberg 
 took it over after Kubrick passed away in 1999. While it possesses many 
 solid attributes, such as a superb John Williams score, the marriage of 
 Spielberg's sensibilities with those of Kubrick result in an uneven mess 
 that will hopefully improve with repeated viewings.&nbsp;

  There are sound arguments both for why the trade 
 war between the US and China may escalate and for why it may not.  
  For 
 the bullish investor, derivatives strategists at Bank of America Merrill 
 Lynch have formulated a trading recommendation after observing that implied 
 volatility jumped as stocks sold off last week.  
 
 
 The stock market's 
 sharp moves since last week appear to track the odds investors are placing 
 on a trade war. 
 Last week, the  S&amp;P 500  suffered its  biggest drop 
 in over two years  as the US and China imposed tariffs on each other's goods. 
 The index  snapped back  on Monday, following  reports over the weekend

 in recent years than President Donald Trump's namesake company, the Trump 
 Organization. 
 At that company, power is currently vested in the hands 
 of Trump's two eldest sons and Allen Weisselberg, a senior official at the 
 business. But there are several officials who make up the upper ring of 
 the Trump Organization. 
 Many of those employees have managed to stay out 
 of the limelight, even at a time when many around the world have their eyes 
 fixated on Trump's company. 
 Here are some of the power players at the 
 Trump Organization:  Donald Trump Jr.

  Trump's 
 eldest son has been the most public face of his father's company since the 
 president took office in early 2017. Part of the arrangement Trump made 
 ahead of taking the presidency was to pass control of the company off to 
 Trump Jr., his brother Eric, and another senior official at the company. 
 
 Trump Jr. currently serves as executive vice president of development 
 and acquisitions for the company.

  Trump's second-oldest son, Eric, also serves as an executive vice 
 president at the company. In  his bio on the Trump Organization website 
 , Eric is listed as spearheading the company's golf portfolio.

  Sorial, whom BuzzFeed once labeled Trump's 
 " right-hand man ," serves as an executive vice president and counsel at 
 the Trump Organization. 
 Upon Trump taking office, the  Trump Organization 
 tapped Sorial  to be chief compliance counsel for any conflicts of interest 
 that arise for the president involving the business. Sorial worked closely 
 with the Trump University project, threatening to sue the Better Business 
 Bureau over the C- score it gave the president's former education platform.

 Google Cloud is experimenting with blockchains ? and it could make us think 
 totally differently the technology (GOOGL)
summary: 
text1:   
 Google has several times that are exploring potential uses for blockchain 
 technology.  
  It's not clear if or how Google will use the technology, 
 but Brian Behlendorf, an expert on the technology, think the company will 
 offer a blockchain product through its Google Cloud service.   
  Blockchains 
 are designed to be decentralized, but one that's linked to a public-cloud 
 service could actually make sense, Behlendorf said.   
 
 
   Google  has 
 long been fond of experimentation, so it should be no surprise the internet 
 giant is looking into what blockchain technology could do for its cloud 
 business. 
 Several different teams inside the company are examining the 
 hyped technology, which is the hard-to-edit digital ledger system that underlies 
 bitcoin, ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, a Google representative said. 
 But the representative declined to share details.&nbsp; 
 "Like many new 
 technologies, we have individuals in various teams exploring potential uses 
 of blockchain but it's way too early for us to speculate about any possible 
 uses or plans," the Google representative said. 
 Fortunately, it doesn't 
 take inside information to imagine what Google may have in store.&nbsp;Indeed, 
 thinking through how Google might use blockchain technology is something 
 Brian Behlendorf, executive director of the open-source blockchain project&nbsp;Hyperledger, 
 has been doing a lot lately. 
 Behlendorf's hunch? Google's going to offer 
 blockchain technology as a product available through its Google Cloud service. 
 Just as Google Cloud customers today can easily set up databases through 
 the service or use it to access Google's machine learning technology, they 
 might be able to someday set up a blockchain through it. 
 Behlendorf doesn't 
 speak for Google. But he's in a good position to speculate on what it might 
 do. His organization, after all, works with companies including IBM and 
 Oracle to develop their enterprise-grade blockchain offerings. 
 The blockchain 
 would be for businesses, not cloud infrastructure 
 Google could potentially 
 develop a blockchain system from scratch. But that could take a lot of time 
 and resources, so the company might just use one that's already been developed,&nbsp;potentially 
 even one from Hyperledger. Hyperledger has two different open-source blockchain 
 systems &mdash; Fabric and Sawtooth &mdash; that it offers for enterprises 
 to use for their projects.&nbsp; 
 Either way, its service would likely 
 allow Google Cloud clients to set up a blockchain ledger and authorize different 
 users &mdash; or nodes &mdash; to make entries on it. 
 "The basic idea 
 is you might take something like Hyperledger Fabric or Sawtooth and go to 
 a company or set of companies and say, 'We will set up your nodes on a permission 
 ledger for a fee,'" Behlendorf said. 
     
 Strategically, it would make 
 sense for Google to add a blockchain product to its cloud service. Google's 
 cloud-related products &mdash; which include Google Docs and a broad range 
 of other services &mdash;   account for $1 billion in quarterly revenue 
 . But Google Cloud itself  is in third place in the cloud-computing market 
 , trailing behind Amazon Web Services and Microsoft's Azure, and it could 
 use something to help set its service apart from the leaders. 
 A public 
 cloud blockchain won't necessarily be decentralized&nbsp; 
 Hosting a blockchain 
 product on a public cloud service may sound strange if you know something 
 about the digital-ledger technology. One of the big selling points of blockchains 
 is that they're decentralized. 
 Exact copies of blockchain ledgers are 
 stored in multiple places, typically on different computers or nodes. In 
 the case of bitcoin's blockchain, the number of nodes is in the thousands. 
 A change to a ledger won't be recognized unless multiple nodes agree on 
 the change. 
 By contrast, public clouds, by their nature, are services 
 that centralize data from multiple companies or users. 
   
 Despite that 
 apparent contradiction, Behlendorf said users shouldn't be worried about 
 a public cloud-based blockchain. 
 Just because a blockchain may start in 
 a public cloud doesn't necessarily mean it can't be decentralized. Indeed, 
 if Google offers a blockchain product through Google Cloud, it likely will 
 embrace decentralization and allow customers to set up nodes for their blockchain 
 ledgers elsewhere, including on other public cloud services such as AWS, 
 he said. 
 That may seem counterintuitive that Google would allow its blockchain 
 product to be accessed through competing cloud services. But it would almost 
 have to offer that flexibility, Behlendorf said. After all, many businesses 
 operate worldwide and will want their blockchains to be accessible wherever 
 they operate, but Google Cloud isn't accessible in China, because the country 
 bans Google.&nbsp; 
 Besides, the main reason for decentralization is to 
 ensure trust among parties that don't know each other. You may not know 
 who's operating a particular node on the bitcoin blockchain, but you can 
 trust that the person has an unadulterated copy of the ledger if it matches 
 up with those on every other node in the system. 
 But public cloud services 
 don't have the same bar for establishing the trust of users.&nbsp;People 
 already know Amazon, Microsoft, Google and trust their services. If you 
 would use a cloud service to store information about your business, you 
 should feel comfortable putting a blockchain on it as well, Behlendorf said. 
 
 In fact, it's already happening. While neither AWS or Azure offers a blockchain 
 product, people already host blockchains on those cloud services, he said.

 Every Steven Spielberg movie, ranked from worst to best
summary: 
text1:   
 Spanning more than 40 years, Steven Spielberg's work&nbsp;boasts an extremely 
 diverse array&nbsp;of stories, characters, and themes. 
 He's made whimsical&nbsp;fantasies&nbsp;aimed 
 squarely at&nbsp;children ("E.T.," "The Adventures of Tintin"), complex&nbsp;morality 
 stories ("Bridge of Spies," "Amistad"), and graphically violent dramas ("Munich," 
 "Saving Private Ryan"). 
 For his latest, "Ready Player One," the Oscar 
 winner returns to his popcorn blockbuster roots and proves that he's still 
 the  king of the genre . 
 Here we take on the difficult task of ranking 
 from worst to best all 32 of Spielberg's feature-length movies.&nbsp;   
 SEE ALSO:&nbsp; All 30 Steven Spielberg movies, ranked by how much money 
 they made at the US box office   
 32. "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of 
 the Crystal Skull" (2008) 
 
  Earning its rightful place at the bottom 
 of this list is the fourth entry in Spielberg's "Indiana Jones" anthology. 
 There are so many problems with this movie. If you really want to understand 
 all of them, we suggest watching Red Letter Media's in-depth  analysis  
 of why it's so bad.&nbsp;Disney announced that Spielberg and star Harrison 
 Ford will reunite for a fifth "Indy" movie. Hopefully, in the words of Max 
 Von Sydow's character in "Star Wars: The Force Awakens," it "will begin 
 to make things right."  
   31. "The Lost World: Jurassic Park" (1997) 
 
 
  Spielberg rushed to deliver&nbsp;a sequel to his 1993 record-breaking 
 box-office smash "Jurassic Park." In the process, he failed to produce a 
 worthy successor to the groundbreaking original. He also created a  scene 
 &nbsp;in which a little girl uses gymnastics to fight a dinosaur that many 
 refer to as the worst thing he's ever done.  
   30. "A.I. Artificial Intelligence" 
 (2001) 
 
  Stanley Kubrick originally intended to direct this project, 
 but Spielberg took it over after Kubrick passed away in 1999. While it possesses 
 many solid attributes, such as a superb John Williams score, the marriage 
 of Spielberg's sensibilities with those of Kubrick result in an uneven mess 
 that will hopefully improve with repeated viewings.&nbsp;

 Mueller Owes It to Prosecutors Nationwide to Uphold Justice Department Standards
summary: 
text1:   
 Orin Kerr is an insightful legal analyst, so when we are in disagreement 
 I take his criticism seriously. Respectfully, however, his Lawfare critique 
 of a recent column in which I took issue with Special Counsel Robert Mueller&#x92;s 
 pleading practices is not his best work. To recap my argument, Mueller&#x92;s 
 tactic of charging sensational offenses and pleading them down to comparatively 
 trivial crimes flouts guidelines that are prescribed in the U.S. Attorney&#x92;s 
 Manual and that are followed by responsible U.S. attorneys&#x92; offices. 
 Kerr objects, contending that a provision in the manual that I did not discuss 
 indicates there is more leeway...

 WASHINGTON        (AP) -- President Donald Trump is again attacking online

 Federal regulators, however, have found the contract with Amazon to be profitable....

 Syrians quit Ghouta as talks for last pocket stutter
summary: 
text1:   
 Hundreds more Syrian rebels and civilians prepared Friday to leave Eastern 
 Ghouta under a negotiated withdrawal, as Russia unilaterally announced a 
 similar deal to empty the final pocket of the battered enclave. The former 
 rebel bastion on the outskirts of Damascus has been drained by a nearly 
 six-week Syrian government assault and two evacuation deals brokered by 
 regime ally Moscow. Under such agreements, rebels agree to hand over territory 
 in exchange for safe passage for them and civilians to opposition-held northwest 
 Syria.

 Thomson Reuters    
 
  Stock research firms are  getting battered so far 
 in 2018 , with revenues declining substantially.  
  Part of the blame is 
 new European regulatory reform, which were widely expected to constrict 
 research budgets.  
  But JPMorgan Chase deserves some of the blame as well 
 for conducting a multi-front attack on sell-side research industry that 
 "pulled a rug out from underneath" its competitors.  
 
 
 The stock research 
 departments of  global banks are suffering this year , with revenues falling 
 in the face of European regulatory reforms that have led their customers 
 to slash research budgets.&nbsp; 
 In the fallout from the  Markets in Financial 
 Instruments Directive II (MiFID II) going live in January, t op-tier banks 
 have seen 10% to 30% declines in research revenues in 2018, while second-tier 
 firms are seeing declines of as much as 60%, according to consulting firm 
 Oliver Wyman.&nbsp;    See the rest of the story at Business Insider   NOW

  Rents in North Brooklyn are falling 
 more than a year before the L train is set to shut down between Brooklyn 
 and Manhattan, according to  StreetEasy .  
  That creates a bargain for 
 people who are willing to make the trade-off for a longer commute.  
  Sales 
 prices aren't falling. But it's taking longer for houses to move off the 
 market.  
 
 
 The impending L-train shutdown is a bargain or a curse, depending 
 on how much of a hellish commute New Yorkers are willing to endure. 
 Starting 
 in April 2019, the tunnel through which the L train runs between Manhattan 
 and Brooklyn is scheduled to be closed for 15 months to repair damage caused 
 by Hurricane Sandy in 2012.    See the rest of the story at Business Insider

 But if you have an innocent client who is the target of an investigation

 of the Cambridge Analytica scandal.  
  Users are not fleeing Facebook yet, 
 partly because they already mistrusted the social media platform, and because 
 of its usefulness.  
  Some Facebook users are taking measures to protect 
 their privacy, but most are on the site just as much as before.

 Loyola is just the latest Cinderella to reach the Final Four ? here is how 
 the others fared

 The No. 11 Loyola-Chicago Ramblers are the 
 feel-good story of the  NCAA Tournament  thus far, continuing their Cinderella 
 run all the way to a spot in the Final Four. 
 While low seeds making it 
 this far into the tournament is not unprecedented, it is somewhat rare &mdash; 
 just 11 teams seeded No. 8 or lower have made it to the Final Four since 
 expanding to 64 teams. Of the ten teams that came before Loyola-Chicago, 
 just one of them has taken home the national championship. 
 Below you can 
 find every team in NCAA Tournament history that entered  March Madness  
 as a No. 8 seed or lower that had made it to a national semifinal.  No. 
 8 Villanova (1985)

  The earliest team we're covering 
 on this list is also the most successful &mdash; the 1985 Villanova Wildcats. 
 As a No. 8 seed, the Wildcats surpassed every expectation and took down 
 Patrick Ewing's Georgetown Hoyas 66-64 in the national title game. Villanova 
 would not make it back to the championship until 2016.  
   No. 11 LSU (1986)

  A year later, LSU would try to capture the 
 same magic the Wildcats did. While the Tigers won their region as a No. 
 11 seed with a shocking victory over Kentucky in the Elite Eight, they almost 
 didn't make it out of the first round of the tournament, needing double-overtime 
 to knock out No. 6 Purdue. LSU would fall short of the title game though, 
 losing to eventual champion Louisville in the Final Four.  
   No. 8 North 
 Carolina (2000)

  While college basketball fans are likely 
 more familiar with UNC as one of the top seeds in March Madness, in 2000 
 the Tar Heels made a run to the Final Four as a No. 8 seed after gutting 
 out a big win over No. 1 Stanford in the second round of the tournament. 
 It was the third time in four years that UNC won their region before losing 
 in the national semifinal.

 survivors &#x91;have no soul&#x92;
summary:

 Ted Nugent went on a conservative radio show Friday evening and lobbed another 
 round of insults at the most outspoken survivors of the Valentine&#x92;s 
 Day mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. 
 During his guest spot on The Joe Pags Show, hosted by Joe Pagliarulo and 
 syndicated from WOAI in San Antonio, Texas, the NRA board member was asked 
 why the &#x93;media&#x94; had turned on the NRA. &#x93;The level of ignorance 
 goes beyond stupidity. Again, the National Rifle Association are a bunch 
 of American families who have a voice to stand up for our God-given constitutionally...

 Who sent the dream to the wife of Pontius Pilate?
summary: 
text1:   
 In the Gospels, it mentions that the wife of Pontius Pilate has a dream that 
 Jesus is innocent and she tells Pilate that he should not condemn Jesus. 
 What she is saying, is indeed true, and if Pilate listened to her, he may 
 have avoided falling into sin. Yet, if Pilate listened to her, this would 
 not have been according to God&#x27;s will. Thus, I am curious to hear your 
 thoughts if this dream came from God, Satan, or other source.

 Over the past few weeks, we&#x92;ve learned a lot about Facebook, Cambridge 
 Analytica, and how Facebook uses your data. The revelations have pushed 
 many users&#x97;including some brands and celebrities&#x97;to leave the 
 social network altogether. Rather than simply deleting your profile or profile 
 information, however, some are advising a slightly different tactic to protect 
 your online identity: tainting that data. Developer and former systems administrator 
 Kevin Matthew published a script that goes back through your Facebook posts 
 and edits them with randomly generated characters. Based on his knowledge 
 as a systems administrator, Matthew explains that &#x93;even by conservative

 THE DIGITAL REMITTANCE REPORT: How tech-savvy challengers are pushing the 
 industry toward a digital-first future
summary: 
text1:   
 BII   Cross-border, peer-to-peer money transfers &mdash; better known as 
 remittances &mdash; are an integral part of societies around the world, 
 especially in developing&nbsp;markets where receiving funds could mean the 
 difference between life and death for families and community who remain 
 behind. This has resulted in a massive global remittance market,&nbsp;which 
 totaled $575 billion in 2016 alone, according to The World Bank.&nbsp; 
 
 However,&nbsp;this&nbsp;pales in comparison to what the future holds for 
 the sector, as globalization creates greater distance between families and 
 digital tools promise to make transferring funds both easier and more efficient.&nbsp; 
 
 This evolution is being accelerated by a number of factors, including&nbsp;several 
 wars leading to the displacement of millions, weather-related&nbsp;disasters 
 resulting in the need for&nbsp;financial relief, a massive workforce moving 
 to stronger economies, and increasing reliance on consumer technology, like 
 smartphones.    See the rest of the story at Business Insider    See Also:

  In response to high customer demand, 
 luxury bed and bath company Boll &amp; Branch has launched  a new pillow 
 ($150) .  
  You can choose a density and down or down-alternative fill 
 that fit your specific likes and needs.&nbsp;  
  The years of attention 
 dedicated to fill material, sourcing, and construction results in a pillow 
 that's fluffy and yielding, yet supportive enough for most types of sleepers.&nbsp; 
  
 
 Since every person sleeps differently, we could debate for hours on

 to their name and a behemoth company under their wing, a bigwig CEO's retirement 
 might look a little different than the norm, whether it's prolonged working 
 or a life of leisure.  
  But, that's not to say their retirement plans 
 can't&nbsp;inspire your own    golden years   .  
  Here, 12 of the world's 
 richest CEOs on what retirement looks like to them &mdash; and what lessons 
 you can steal from those ideals.   Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon

  When 
 once asked what he'd be doing if he wasn't 'Jeff Bezos,'    Bezos said  
  , "I have this fantasy of being a bartender. I pride myself on my craft 
 cocktails."  
  Bartender Bezos sounds like the perfect retirement dream. 
 Second acts are    common among retirees   , who fantasize about pursuing 
 something new or different during their next chapter.   
  Branch out and 
 begin an encore career from one of your underlying passions or talents &mdash; 
 like creating boozy cocktails.

  "If I quit today &mdash; I see these people. They spend a whole week 
 planning their haircut. That is not my idea of living,"    Buffett once 
 said   , adding that it would be "crazy" for him to leave his job. "I would 
 rather do this than anything in the world."  
  At 87 years old, Buffett 
 is still steering the helm of Berkshire Hathaway. If you love what you do 
 as much as he does, know there are a few benefits to sticking with your 
 work.  
   Research shows    that retiring at the age of eligibility has 
 a detrimental effect on cognitive ability.   Working even a year beyond 
 retirement age have a significantly lower mortality rate.   
   Michael 
 Dell, CEO of Dell 
  Drew Angerer/Getty 
     Net worth: $23.2 billion  
 
    Forbes 400 ranking: #14  
  "I think being 50 years old and being in 
 good health, [retirement and succession] is not a likely scenario anytime 
 soon," Dell told    Economic Times    in 2015. "I'm having a good time, 
 the business is doing well, can't do it forever, but it's working well and 
 we don't have a problem."  
  While some dream of an early retirement, others 
 dream of prolonging it. If you're happy and thriving in your career, there's 
 no reason to hang up your skates early &mdash; and when you do, you'll rest 
 easier knowing that you spent more time    building your wealth    and collecting 
 social security.  
  If you delay retirement past full retirement age (up 
 to age 70), you can qualify for    delayed requirement credits    that increase 
 the value of your social security payments by 8% for every year you wait.

 JPMorgan has identified the perfect Tesla trade to protect against Model 
 3 'production hell'
summary:

 AP Images / Mark Lennihan    
 
  Tesla is expected to provide an update 
 to its Model 3 production schedule sometime early next month.  
  The derivatives 
 team at JPMorgan says the risks around the event aren't adequately priced 
 into the market right now and offer a trade recommendation.  
 
 
 When 
 it comes to  Tesla 's stock, it's usually the latest  Model 3  production 
 data that dictates much of its trading &mdash; which is why the company's 
 release, expected early next month, will be so important for shareholders 
 deciding what to do going forward. 
 But the derivatives team at  JPMorgan 
  doesn't think investors should let it get to that, and it has an idea for 
 how they can brace for the worst ahead of time. After all, even Tesla's 
 CEO,  Elon Musk , has labeled the Model 3 situation " production hell ," 
 suggesting traders would be well-advised to keep their wits about them.

 with a lot of help from gutless corporations, are still determined to dismantle

 A radical technique that makes mature cells act like stem cells is growing 
 a mini brain from tissue I donated. One day it could produce whole organs 
 for transplant Last week, I was told my other brain is fully grown. It doesn?t 
 look like much. A blob of pale flesh about the size of a small pea, it floats 
 in a bath of blood-red nutrient. It would fit into the cranium of a foetus 
 barely a month old.  Still, it?s a ?brain? after a fashion and it?s made 
 from me. From a piece of my arm, to be precise.   Continue reading...

 Jesse Lingard shines as quickfire Manchester United cruise past Swansea
summary: 
text1:  
 Paul Pogba returned to the starting line up, Romelu Lukaku scored his 100th 
 Premier League goal and Alexis Sánchez rediscovered his finishing prowess, 
 though this comfortable victory over a pedestrian Swansea side was not just 
 about Manchester United?s expensive acquisitions.  Following on from his 
 excellent performance for England in midweek, Jesse Lingard was not just 
 the star of another show, at times in the game he was running the show. 
 Watching the 25-year-old lay on both goals it was hard to believe he was 
 considered peripheral a few months ago, or that his first-team appearances 
 seemed likely to be rationed after the arrival of Sánchez.   Continue reading...

 Marko Arnautovic double lifts West Ham and sinks Southampton
summary: 
text1:  
 What a relief it was for the West Ham hierarchy that the only boos at the 
 London Stadium floated out of the away end. There were no pitch invasions, 
 no missiles thrown at the directors? box. David Gold and David Sullivan 
 were able to keep Sir Trevor Brooking company until the final whistle this 
 time and if there was a hint of mutiny, it came from the Southampton fans 
 who watched their bedraggled team sink closer towards the Championship on 
 an afternoon when the hosts found a way to keep their bitter civil war hidden 
 from their guests.  Of course, it should be pointed out that Southampton 
 did not even begin to flirt with the idea of testing the strength of West

 Simon Tisdall | Will clashes over Gaza cause a wider Middle Eastern conflict?
summary: 
text1:  
 Lebanon, Iran and other nations may now be drawn into a spiral of conflict 
 Tightly wound and anticipating trouble, Israeli troops opened fire before 
 the Gaza border protests had even begun. The Palestinian health ministry 
 said Omar Samour, a 31-year-old farmer, was picking parsley in his field 
 near Khan Yunis early on Friday morning when he was killed. Another farmer 
 was injured by shrapnel. Israel?s military later confirmed its tanks had 
 fired at  ?suspicious figures? on the border .  Samour?s death was a grim 
 augury of what was to come. As Palestinians observed a day of mourning on 
 Saturday, both sides warned of possible escalation in the weeks ahead. But 
 a bigger question is exercising regional analysts. Will this violent yet 
 long-predicted rekindling of the Israel-Palestine conflict trigger  a wider 
 crisis  drawing in Lebanon, Syria and Iran?   Continue reading...

 Dressed in excess: people put on all their clothes ? in pictures
summary: 
text1:  
 Canadian photographer  Libby Oliver ?s striking portrait series,  Soft Shells 
 , is a playful exploration of how people express themselves through clothes. 
 It features individuals swathed in every item from their wardrobe, flashes 
 of body parts only just visible. ?Clothing is an immediate social cue,? 
 Oliver says, ?and one of the few things we have visual control over with 
 ourselves.? The subjects range from Ava, four, to Oliver?s grandma Florence, 
 who is 88.   Oliver started the project last summer and now has people itching 
 to get involved. She hopes the series can develop internationally, to explore 
 other cultures and catalogue ?the varying masses of clothing and textures 
 in the world?. She does, however, admit that the enthusiasm of her subjects 
 has its limits. ?I have to move quickly, because those piles of fabric are 
 quite suffocating!?   Continue reading...

 4 exercise routines you can do without a gym membership, according to fitness 
 experts
summary:

 Ilya Naymushin/Reuters    
 
  Exercise routines can still be effective without 
 gym equipment.  
  Doing a 10-minute exercise routine composed of cardio 
 and strength exercises can strengthen muscles and prevent a weak core.  
  
  Running outdoors is one of the most effective ways to get fit, though 
 it is important to vary the intensity of the workout and to take regular 
 breaks.&nbsp;  
 
 
 I'm in pretty good shape, overall: I run four to five 
 times a week, do calisthenics, and do a decent amount of strength training. 
 What I basically never do, however, is go to the gym. 
 I had a fitness 
 club membership in the past, which I made use of a few times a week. However, 
 over time, I came to realize that not only did I not need a gym to stay 
 in shape, but I preferred the cardio exercise and strength training routines 
 I could create for myself either outdoors or in my own home.    See the

 Hillary Clinton has been known to make huge sums in speaking fees, but Thursday&#x92;s 
 reported payment may sound like she was short-changed. Clinton was paid 
 $25,000 to speak at Rutgers University about being targeted as a woman in 
 politics, the upcoming elections and the Trump administration, among other 
 topics, NJ.com reported. But the money she made seemed to be considerably 
 less than some other high-profile guests who&#x27;ve spoken at the New Jersey 
 school. For example, Nicole &#x93;Snooki&#x94; Polizzi, of &#x93;Jersey 
 Shore&#x94; fame, was paid $32,000 for her Rutgers appearance in 2011. Students

 Israel abstained from accusing Moscow of the poisoning of former spy Sergei

 The Shifts Behind the Shootings

 During briefings as a patrol officer, I scanned the crime reports from the 
 prior week, looking for patterns, trends and changes. If, for example, I 
 discovered an increase in car burglaries on the west side of town, I would 
 ask the simple question: What shifted in the past few weeks to account for 
 the additional crimes? More robberies on the east side? What&#x92;s changed? 
 Did someone new move into the area? Did some group of offenders decide to 
 target our city? Now, as a cold-case detective and author, I apply the same 
 approach to a new crime phenomenon: the increase...

 LOS ANGELES -- Joe Panik won&#x27;t hit 162 home runs that account for the

 such games are rare enough. For the second game in a row, Panik was the 
 only player on either team to touch home plate without kicking it in frustration. 
 His ninth-inning home run Friday off Kenley Jansen, the Dodgers&#x27; formidable 
 closer, gave the Giants a 1-0 victory that was nothing short of precedent-setting. 
 According to STATS, Panik, who went deep off Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw 
 in Tuesday&#x27;s season opener, is the first Major Leaguer...

 A large crack that has suddenly appeared in Kenya&#x92;s Rift Valley is evidence

 miles and continues to grow, but it does not go all the way across the surface. 
 If it does, it will split the continent into two. The crack has caused part 
 of the Nairobi-Narok highway to collapse and also accelerating seismic activity 
 in the area, leading researchers to believe that something dramatic could 
 happen in the future. &#x93;The Great Rift splits Africa into two plates.

 Since persistently smearing former FBI director James Comey has not moved

  now framing it as Comey?s patriotic obligation. 
 Comey has a number of 
 sure-to-be-blockbuster  interviews scheduled  as  part of an upcoming book 
 tour. Hannity must be burning up with jealousy  knowing the high ratings 
 that everyone he hates will get when Comey  appears on  their shows : Rachel 
 Maddow, Stephen Colbert,  Anderson Cooper and George Stephanopoulos, e.g.

 outperformance over global stocks, according to Bank of America Merrill 
 Lynch.

 US stocks 
 this year are at risk of ending their outperformance trend over global stocks, 
 according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
 The S&amp;P 500, a benchmark 
 of US stocks, has outperformed the MSCI All-Country World Index through 
 most of the post-financial-crisis era. The index, however, "still shows 
 signs of a 2-year+ top relative to MSCI ACWI," Stephen Suttmeier, a BAML 
 technical analyst, said in a note on Sunday.    See the rest of the story

 Friday that she is taking next week off, after almost a dozen advertisers 
 dropped her show after the conservative pundit mocked a teenage survivor 
 of the Florida school massacre on Twitter.

 Would stepping on the first butterfly really change the history of evolution?
summary: 
text1:   
 Martha Jones: It&#x27;s like in those films: if you step on a butterfly, 
 you change the future of the human race. The Doctor: Then don&#x27;t step 
 on any butterflies. What have butterflies ever done to you? Science fiction 
 writers can&#x27;t seem to agree on the rules of time travel. Sometimes, 
 as in Doctor Who (above), characters can travel in time and affect small 
 events without appearing to alter the grand course of history. In other 
 stories, such as Back To The Future, even the tiniest of the time travellers&#x27; 
 actions in the past produce major ripples that unpredictably change...

 When I spoke at the Patriot Movement Arizona rally in early March, I heard 
 a lot of people say &#xE2;&#x80;&#x9C;Make California America Again.&#xE2;&#x80;&#x9D; 
 A former Navy seal who later ran for Congress made the same joke to me when 
 he was out of state. &#xE2;&#x80;&#x9C;I&#xE2;&#x80;&#x99;m not in California 
 right now. I&#xE2;&#x80;&#x99;m in America.&#xE2;&#x80;&#x9D;Those comments 
 really incensed me, though. Four and a half million Californians voted for 
 Trump in 2016. Even though the state legislature has gone full-tilt communist, 
 Californians up and down the state are rising up against the state legislature, 
 which has become destructive to the ends for which...

summary:

 FRANKFORT- Attorney General Andy Beshear, D-Kentucky, says he will sue if 
 Governor Bevin signs the newly passed pension reform bill. Republican members

 School districts across the state close as teachers call-in after pension 
 bill passes
summary: 
text1:   
 One-by-one school districts across central Kentucky announced their closure 
 the day before spring break, as Republicans in the House and Senate rammed 
 through a mystery pension reform bill. The 291 page bill was not made public, 
 and was inserted into a waste-sewage piece of legislation on Thursday, and 
 then sent though the lower and upper chambers with Republicans carrying 
 the bill. Fayette County schools was among the first to announce a closure 
 on Thursday night, as more than a thousand teachers called in sick from 
 work and there were not enough substitutes to cover the absences. &#x93;All

 Trump's tax plan should save the largest American companies $150 billion 
 ? here's how they're spending that money

  Billionaire investor  Paul Tudor Jones 
  cofounded the nonprofit  Just Capital  in 2013 to measure what Americans 
 want from corporations and evaluate which of these companies are contributing 
 to a "more just" society.  
   President Donald Trump's tax plan  is set 
 to save the 1,000 largest American companies $150 billion this year.  
 
  Just Capital has analyzed 120 of these companies, whose savings account 
 for about one-third of the total, and found that only about 6% of the windfall 
 was going toward wages that weren't one-time bonuses.  
  This post is part 
 of Business Insider's ongoing series on&nbsp; Better Capitalism .  
 
 
 
  When Congress passed the Republican tax plan in December, President Donald 
 Trump said it was "above all else a jobs bill." 
 By drastically cutting 
 the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, the Trump administration said it 
 would incentivize companies to stay in the United States and in turn save 
 them $1 trillion over the next decade, with $150 billion this year, that 
 they could invest in workers and job creation.    See the rest of the story

 'Teflon Trudeau' is his own worst enemy
summary: 
text1:   
 Latest polls suggest that support for Justin Trudeau's Liberal government 
 has dropped to 36% following a controversial trip to India.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  
  In New Delhi, Trudeau incited debate when he attended a dinner in the 
 Canadian high commissioner's residence. Jaspal Atwal, a Sikh extremist who 
 served jail time in Canada,&nbsp;was also on the guest list.&nbsp;  
  Trudeau's 
 circle attempted to lay the blame on both the Indian government and on&nbsp;a 
 Sikh Canadian MP.&nbsp;  
  Trudeau also caused offense by wearing brightly 
 colored traditional Indian clothing.  
 
 
 Canadian Prime Minister Justin 
 Trudeau's honeymoon with voters was supposed to end on May 18, 2016. In 
 Parliament that day, members of the leftist New Democratic Party (NDP) attempted 
 to obstruct their fellow MPs as they took their assigned places to vote 
 on a time-sensitive motion. In a scene captured on video, Trudeau pushed 
 a Conservative Party opposition member through the crowd to hurry things 
 along, elbowing a female member of the NDP in the process. The Conservative 
 MP Peter Van Loan described it as "physical molestation." An NDP member 
 called it "assault." Pundits coined it "Elbowgate" and declared that this 
 would be the scandal that finally put a scratch on Teflon Trudeau's political 
 career. 
 It didn't. Within a week, polls  showed  that voters didn't care 
 about Elbowgate. They also didn't care much about Trudeau abandoning his 
 campaign promises on  electoral reform , revelations about his  cash-for-access 
 political fundraising , or his  oddly affectionate comments  following the 
 death of Fidel Castro. For more than two years as prime minister &mdash; 
 an eternity in politics &mdash; Trudeau's government has seemed to defy 
 gravity.    See the rest of the story at Business Insider   NOW WATCH:

  There's a crowded trade in the US stock market 
 that Morgan Stanley warns could lead to a brutal unwinding.  
  In many 
 ways, last week's equity sell-off was a dry run for how deep the pain can 
 run when this strategy starts to unravel.  
 
 
 The herd mentality often 
 employed by equity investors is, in many ways, the ultimate double-edged 
 sword. 
 During prosperous times of unabated  stock  gains, the so-called 
 momentum trade &mdash; which involves piling into proven winners &mdash; 
 is an unmitigated home run. But what about when the market is selling off?

 When Facebook loses, who wins? That?s a question for startups that may be

 company?s valuation has fallen by around $60 billion since the Cambridge

title:   
 Unpacking the Fictional Japan of  Isle of Dogs
summary: Wes Anderson?s film uses elements of the country?s language and culture to create a fraught sense of unfamiliarity.
text1:  
 One of the best sequences in Wes Anderson?s new stop-motion film  Isle of 
 Dogs  is of a sushi chef preparing a boxed lunch. In a bird?s-eye shot, 
 we see the chef?s hands pin a still-living fish, chop off its head and tail, 
 set it to the side in a shallow bowl, and fillet the carcass. A wriggling 
 octopus leg is held deftly, cut into neat rectangles, and pressed onto handfuls 
 of vinegar rice. The chef dots vivid-green wasabi on each slice of octopus, 
 arranging the sushi carefully in a lacquered bento box. This beautifully 
 executed sequence is identical to the process so many sushi  shokunin  undertake, 
 as they stand behind counters performing for hungry audiences. It is also 
 the only scene in  Isle of Dogs  that needs to be set in Japan.  That?s 
 because Anderson?s movie, despite featuring Japanese voice actors and iconography, 
 isn?t really about the East Asian nation. The fictional metropolis of Megasaki 
 is the fantastical setting for this tale about a boy searching for his dog, 
 who has been exiled with all other canines to an island made of trash. Critics 
 and viewers might argue that this invented city, which exists in a parallel 
 universe 20 years in the future, eases the story?s burden of faithfully 
 representing Japan. But even given this leeway, Anderson?s Megasaki at times 
 slides dangerously close to tokenism, and often fails to truly bring to 
 mind the country the director claims to invoke (a point I?ll return to in 
 a moment).    Why then does  Isle of Dogs  take place in Japan ?or in a 
 land that gestures at Japan via curated aesthetic flourishes and references? 
 Some have rightly pointed out that this decision is in line with the director?s 
 style.  As the  L.A. Times ? Justin Chang put it in his review of the movie 
 , ?every one of Anderson?s films is an act of imaginative plundering?a crazy-quilt 
 of popular touchstones and personal influences, tailored to a specific milieu.? 
 But it?s also worth moving beyond the question of appropriation and considering 
  Isle of Dogs ?s use of Japan as a backdrop. In the film, the country is 
 a plot device that creates a vague sense of unfamiliarity to move the story 
 forward and explain away bizarre narrative elements. It?s an approach that 
 relies on a long Western tradition of, intentionally or otherwise, rendering 
 Japan as a mysterious land with an incomprehensible people and culture. 
  * * *  The strangeness of Japan figures into the movie?s largest plot point: 
 the banishing of all dogs to Trash Island. In the opening scenes, Megasaki 
 Mayor Kobayashi (voiced by Kunichi Nomura, also one of the film?s co-writers) 
 gives a vitriolic speech explaining the quarantine as a response to an outbreak 
 of incurable ?dog flu? and ?snout fever.? This reasoning is thrown into 
 question immediately by Kobayashi?s political opponent, Professor Watanabe, 
 who claims a cure-all serum is already in the process of being engineered. 
 Anderson slyly hints to the audience that his villain, Kobayashi, has an 
 ulterior motive we will later come to understand.  But  Isle of Dogs ?s 
 explanations for the mayor?s actions are scattered. Sometimes, it offers 
 a jaunty historical narrative, citing the Kobayashi family?s distaste for 
 dogs on account of their devotion to cats. A Kobayashi Shinto-esque shrine 
 even displays two feline guardian statues on its steps (though most Japanese 
 shrines use guardian lion-dogs called  Komainu ). At other points, the film 
 suggests the motive is financial, depicting the Kobayashi clan as staging 
 an industrial coup of sorts, like a quirky Andersonian take on the  zaibatsu 
  (a term for the family-controlled business monopolies that dominated Japan 
 until the end of World War II). What the coup accomplishes, though, is unclear. 
 Does the family want to replace all the real dogs with robot dogs issued 
 by the government? Are the robot dogs a response to their prejudice toward 
 real dogs?  Whatever the logic, by the end of the film, Mayor Kobayashi 
 brandishes a red button that if pushed will cause all dogs to be executed 
 via poison wasabi?a baffling move the audience, seemingly, isn?t expected 
 to question. In response, the film?s human hero, a boy named Atari (Koyu 
 Rankin), makes a triumphant entrance, ostensibly to convince Megasaki?s 
 citizens not to abandon their canine companions. But instead of any meaningful 
 confrontation, Atari stands on Mayor Kobayashi?s stage and delivers a plaintive 
 haiku in favor of ?man?s best friend.? At this point in the film, Anderson 
 has already conditioned his audience to shelve their skepticism, and to 
 accept that a poetry reading can be a meaningful denouement to the story?s 
 many conflicts. Taken alongside the movie?s cultural oversights and reinterpretations, 
 this conclusion is just another instance of  Isle of Dogs  using Japan as 
 a way to normalize outlandishness, thus creating the illusion of a cohesive 
 story.  * * *  The perceived foreignness of Japan also figures heavily into 
 the movie?s approach to dialogue. Up until  Isle of Dogs , Anderson?s oeuvre 
 had been characterized by punchy writing and crisply articulated delivery. 
 No matter how awkward the character delivering the line, Anderson made sure 
 audiences knew exactly what was said. But the Japanese-language dialogue 
 employed in this film borders on unintelligible. Though the canines are 
 voiced by white American actors, the humans speak Japanese?while occasionally 
 being spoken over by Frances McDormand?s character, who provides English 
 translations throughout the movie. The result is a sort of auditory cacophony. 
  In a piece by  Vulture ?s Emily Yoshida , other Japanese speakers who saw 
 the film had a hard time understanding the Japanese characters: ?It kind 
 of sounded like they had put cotton balls in their mouth,? one viewer said. 
 ?It was distracting, because I wanted to hear what they were saying.?  At 
 one point, before allowing his opponents to make a counter-speech, Mayor 
 Kobayashi inexplicably barks out ?Risupekto!,? a Japanized pronunciation 
 of ?respect? that isn?t used in colloquial Japanese. While there are many 
 English words that are commonly used in Japan,  Isle of Dogs  opts to invent 
 its own. For instance, instead of having his characters say ?osuwari? (sit), 
 Anderson has them parody English by shouting ?Sitto!,? another word Japanese 
 speakers don?t use. This emphasis on certain pseudo-English words ends up 
 making the actual Japanese spoken feel like decorative background chatter. 
 (For what it?s worth, the aforementioned sushi scene is completely dialogue-free, 
 preserving its authenticity as a snapshot of Japanese culture.)  Some  writers 
 have also  criticized Anderson?s handling of the main human character, Atari. 
 Though best known as the name of a popular video-game console, ?Atari? isn?t 
 an actual Japanese name. Depending on the inflection, it could be the word 
 meaning a ?hit,? or a ?correct guess??not that Japanese-speaking audiences 
 are ever given an opportunity to figure this out. Viewers never hear the 
 main character?s name spoken in his native tongue. In  Isle of Dogs  and 
 elsewhere, Japan and its visual and linguistic characteristics serve as 
 a whimsical wonderland for Western auteurs to interpret and re-create.  
 As I noted earlier, treating Japan as a symbol or narrative device has long 
 been part of Western storytelling. In 1885, the British librettist W.S. 
 Gilbert and composer Arthur Sullivan wrote  The Mikado , an absurd comic 
 opera that takes place in the fictional Titipu, Japan. Much like  Isle of 
 Dogs ,  The Mikado  isn?t actually about Japan; it uses the exotic setting 
 of ?the Far East?  as a vehicle to satirize British politics. In his review 
 for  The New Yorker ,  Richard Brody wrote  that ?for Anderson, Japan is 
 a sort of mirror-America,? offering a reflection on ?the xenophobic, racist, 
 and demagogic strains of contemporary American politics.?  (It could be 
 argued, though, that an internment narrative like  Isle of Dogs ?s, wherein 
 Japanese characters detain English-speaking ones, implies an anachronistic 
 reversal that borders on distasteful.)  In 2003, Sofia Coppola directed 
  Lost in Translation , a film starring Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson 
 (who are also in  Isle of Dogs ) as melancholy Americans staying at a hotel 
 in Tokyo. Coppola renders the capital through their eyes: as a city of scrambled 
 sidewalks, illegible neon signs, and sexually perverted citizens who can?t 
 keep their R?s and L?s straight. In 2016, the horror film   The Forest  
   dropped  its American protagonists in Japan?s Aokigahara?a real-life forest 
 known for its high incidence of suicides?while trivializing the deaths that 
 have occurred there. (Aokigahara came to global attention recently when 
 the American YouTube celebrity Logan Paul uploaded a video  making light 
 of a suicide  there; around the same time, he  uploaded a video  of him 
 and his friends screaming and throwing things at people in Tokyo, at one 
 point crowing, ?I swear, Tokyo is just a giant playground.?)   Isle of Dogs 
 , too, regards Japan as a curiosity that doubles as useful scenery.  Anderson 
 himself has acknowledged that  a tale about canines living in a garbage 
 dump could?ve taken place anywhere, but said the film ?came together? when 
 set in a ?fantasy version of Japan.? However gorgeously animated or meticulously 
 constructed, the fantasy that pulled  Isle of Dogs  together is also what 
 breaks it apart. What could have been a poignant ode to the genuine and 
 precious relationship humans share with their pets (styled after  Moonrise 
 Kingdom  and its irreverence toward childhood) or a meditation on legacy 
 (like  The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou ) is ultimately degraded by a 
 convenient plot trick. Once again, Japan is reduced from a real place to 
 a quaint tool, just eccentric and malleable enough to keep  Isle of Dogs 
  narratively afloat, as it has buoyed other Western stories through the 
 years.

 The Most Amazing Special Forces Fighters You&#x27;ve Never Heard Of

 On September 11, 2001, al-Qaeda terrorists horrifically attacked the United 
 States, killing 2,996 people, injuring over 6,000, and causing $10 billion 
 in infrastructure damage. President George W. Bush in addressing the nation 
 stated how &#x22;these acts shatter steel, but they cannot dent the steel 
 of American resolve.&#x22; This was no more evident than when U.S. Special 
 Forces teams were deployed as a first response to what happened on 9/11. 
 A recent movie, 12 Strong, based on the book by Doug Stanton, Horse Soldiers, 
 documents those soldiers&#x27; stories. A former Green Beret, Scott Neil

summary:

 It has been more than two decades since a running back went No. 1 overall 
 in the NFL Draft. Could this be the year that drought ends? It seems unlikely, 
 but not impossible, that the Browns could select Penn State?s Saquon Barkley

 &#x27;Conservative&#x27; British Newspaper Glorifies Stormy Daniels
summary: 
text1:   
 The supposedly conservative Times of London (owned by Rupert Murdoch) has 
 published a rather long article about the Stormy Daniels controversy. Although 
 you&#x27;d expect a conservative newspaper to be critical of both Donald 
 Trump and the (former) porn actress, nothing could be further from the truth. 
 The Times clearly has a favorite in this match. And it&#x27;s not the U.S. 
 president. In the article, one Daniels-admirer after another is quoted. 
 We are told that she&#x27;s extremely intelligent, clever, and smart. Feisty. 
 She has as thick a skin as anyone. Oh yeah, Stormy Daniels is one tough 
 lady. &#x27;&#x93;She is basically...

 New mind-reading machine can translate your thoughts and display them as

summary: 
text1:   
 Scientists have developed an astonishing mind-reading machine which can translate 
 what you are thinking and instantly display it as text. They claim that 
 it has an accuracy rate of 90 per cent or more and say that it works by 
 interpreting consonants and vowels in our brains. The researchers believe 
 that the machine could one day help patients who suffer from conditions 
 that don&#x27;t allow them to speak or move. The machine registers and analyses 
 the combination of vowels and consonants that we use when constructing a 
 sentence in our brains. It interprets these sentences based on neural signals

 end to transform this city and make it worthy of the vision of a great and 
 progressive society espoused by former President Obama.&#x22; Among the

 Thoughts on a Native Renaissance

 A friend put me onto an excellent review of the movie Wind River, now on 
 Netflix, about life and crime among the Arapaho Indians on the Wind River 
 Reservation. The movie realistically depicts life on most any Indian reservation 
 today &#x96; the poverty, the solitude, the despair. The murders in the 
 movie were committed by drunken whites, but they could have been Indians 
 or Latinos or whatever. For over a decade, I taught high school on the Navajo 
 Reservation, where this movie could have been situated just as honestly. 
 These people live with violence. The guy in Wind River laid...

 Signs your food sensitivity is actually an allergy
summary: 
text1:

  Food sensitivities and allergies can 
 have some similar symptoms, but are very different conditions.  
  Allergies 
 can be life-threatening and intolerances usually aren't.  
   You can usually 
 eat quite a bit of a food to which you're intolerant before having a reaction, 
 but just a few bites of a food that you're allergic to.&nbsp;   
   Here's 
 how to tell if your reaction is a food sensitivity or an allergy.   
 
 
 
 Warring with an upset stomach after enjoying a cheese plate isn't just 
 disappointing &mdash; it can be flat-out confusing. On the one hand, you 
 may have an allergy to dairy, but maybe you're just lactose intolerant. 
 Unfortunately, those conditions are not created equal, so knowing what sets 
 them apart is important. 
  The big distinction? Allergies can be life-threatening 
 and intolerances usually aren't, says&nbsp;  Carla McGuire Davis, MD  , 
 associate professor of pediatrics in immunology, allergy, and rheumatology 
 at Baylor College of Medicine. That's why you can usually eat quite a bit 
 of a food to which you're intolerant before having a reaction, while just 
 a few bites of a food that you're allergic to can set you off.&nbsp;

summary:

 Viktor Orbán?s almost certain re-election relies on an anti-Jewish and anti-Muslim 
 manifesto You may think Hungary is a faraway country. Small and landlocked, 
 it has a baffling Finno-Ugric language few outsiders master. What do its 
 corruptions and conspiracy theories have to do with us? When I was last 
 in Budapest in August, I met Marta Pardavi. I worried about her and her 
 friends in the Hungarian human rights movement, but I did not think I needed 
 to transfer my fears back to Britain.  To understand her predicament, you 
 must know that the ruling party, Fidesz, and its capo, Viktor Orbán, rigs 
 the constitution, the electoral system,  most of the media , the  judiciary 
  and Hungary?s cultural institutions. The handmaiden of autocracy is  corruption 
 . If Hungarians want to  see a doctor  or win a government contract, they 
 have learned to reach into their pockets. Budapest is not a European capital 
 now: it is Moscow on the Danube.   Continue reading...

 any of us would then pursue that as a career.?  Shaking yourself free of 
 Asian stereotypes is a burden that most second-generation immigrants have 
 had to deal with. Indeed, for British Pakistani musician  Iqbal , perhaps

summary:

 The Gavin and Stacey creator has turned a forgotten script into her debut 
 novel. There are no rules to writing a book, she says  Ruth Jones is a Welsh 
 actor and screenwriter who has appeared in  Little Britain ,  Nighty Night 
  and  Gavin and Stacey , which she co-wrote with James Corden. Her most 
 recent role was Stella in the Sky 1 series of the same name, which she also 
 wrote and produced. Her debut novel,  Never Greener , about a mid-life couple 
 who try to recapture the lost love of their youth, is published next month 
 by Bantam Press (£12.99).   Why did you decide to write a novel after so 
 many years writing for television?  I originally wrote  Never Greener  as 
 a screenplay and nothing came of it. Then a couple of years ago I went for 
 a spa break and, flicking through my laptop, I came across the screenplay 
 and 1,000 words I?d forgotten I had written trying to adapt it as fiction. 
 I picked it up again and started writing, just for the love of it really, 
 and found I really enjoyed it.   Continue reading...

 Democrats move even further left. Trump say he will use the military to 
 Fund some of the Wall and the same thing happens. Democrats don&#x27;t care 
 if they go so far left that they don&#x27;t care about the dead ranchers 
 and the drugs runners pouring across our borders....

 Russia&#x27;s Tragic Abortion Tale
summary: 
text1:   
 In 1920, under Bolshevik rule, Russia was the first country to legalize abortion 
 up to birth without restrictions. The method by Lenin&#x92;s political faction 
 was a way to destroy the family unit and to free women into the workforce. 
 The Bolsheviks even designed the machine for suction abortions that is still 
 used widely in abortion clinics across America. Joseph Stalin outlawed the 
 practice in 1936, and it remained illegal in the country until after his 
 death in 1953. Until recently, Russian women reportedly had seven abortions 
 over their lifetime. In 2003, BBC reported there were 13 abortions for every 
 10...

 Stephon Clark &#x27;deserved it,&#x27; nurse wrote on Facebook. Now she&#x27;s

summary:

 Kaiser Permanente has parted ways with a nurse whose Facebook comments about 
 Stephon Clark, the unarmed black man killed by Sacramento police on March 
 18, incited a social media firestorm after an activist put them in the spotlight. 
 The comment: &#x93;Yeah but he was running from the police jumping over 
 fences and breaking in peoples houses&#x85; why run??!!! He deserved it 
 for being stupid.&#x94; Activist Christina Arechiga told The Sacramento 
 Bee earlier this week that she was so disgusted by the statement from a 
 woman named Faith Linthicum that she went to her Facebook profile to learn 
 more about her....

 Ted Nugent Calls Parkland Students 'Souless' And 'Liars' For Demonstrating 
 Against Gun Violence
summary: 
text1:  
 It didn't take long for NRA board member Ted Nugent to delve back into his 
 despicable past that he  claimed to have put behind  him. 
 Watching high 
 school students (who survived a massacre at the hands of an assault weapon-wielding 
 maniac) lead protests against the NRA in support of stricter gun control 
 laws has been too much for many conservative pundits, which now includes 
 Nugent. 
 Fox News' Laura Ingraham ran herself out of town after she levied 
 very personal attacks against David Hogg. 
 So Ted took  up the slack  on 
 Newsmax radio. 
 NUGENT: The dumbing down of America is manifested in the 
 culture deprivation of our academia that have taught these kids the lies, 
 media that have prodded and encouraged and provided these kids lies. I really 
 feel sorry for them because it?s not only ignorant and dangerously stupid, 
 but it?s soulless. To attack the good law-abiding families of America when 
 well-known, predictable murderers commit these horrors is deep in the category 
 of soulless. These poor children -- I?m afraid to say this and it hurts 
 me to say this, but the evidence is irrefutable. They have no soul.

 THE MOBILE CARRIER LANDSCAPE: How AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Sprint are 
 overcoming slow user growth amid a fierce price war
summary: 
text1:   
 This is a preview of a research report from BI Intelligence, Business Insider's 
 premium research service. To learn more about BI Intelligence,&nbsp; click 
 here .   
  It hasn't been smooth sailing for telecoms in recent years. 
 Native voice and messaging services, which once accounted for&nbsp;the vast 
 majority of telecoms' subscriber revenue, are struggling to compete with&nbsp;over-the-top 
 (OTT)&nbsp;apps, like Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and Viber &mdash; and 
 they're losing.  
  A fierce and ongoing price war among the Big Four carriers 
 is only compounding the pressure telecoms are facing. The consequent resurgence 
 of&nbsp;unlimited data&nbsp;plans is&nbsp;straining carriers' networks,&nbsp;and 
 revenues are suffering.  
  Nevertheless, telecoms are now better positioned 
 than ever to play a bigger&nbsp;role in their subscribers' lives. Consumers 
 spend more than half of their&nbsp; digital time &nbsp;on smartphones, compared 
 with a third on PCs. This shift has effectively placed telecoms at the front 
 door of consumers' digital experience.  
  In a new report&nbsp;from BI 
 Intelligence, we examine where the wireless industry stands as a result 
 of the price war and uptick in data demand from consumers. We also&nbsp;look&nbsp;at 
 how technological advancements and the adoption of new product lines could 
 incentivize the next wave of revenue growth for telecoms. Finally, we explore 
 potential barriers to&nbsp;carriers' growth, and examine which of the Big 
 Four carriers are poised to lead the pack.  
  Here are some of the key 
 takeaways from the report:  
 
 Native voice and messaging services, which 
 once accounted for&nbsp;the vast majority of telecoms' subscriber revenue, 
 are struggling to compete with&nbsp;over-the-top apps. 
 A fierce ongoing 
 price war among the Big Four is only compounding the pressure telecoms are 
 facing. 
 Still, consumers' growing dependence on smartphones and data means 
 telecoms are now better positioned than ever to play a bigger&nbsp;role 
 in their subscribers' lives. 
 As digital continues to reshape the wireless 
 industry, telecoms are preparing for the next wave of disruption, including 
 connected cars, augmented reality, and 5G. 
 Despite a plethora of&nbsp;opportunities, 
 several existing and emerging threats could impede telecoms' growth and 
 expansion efforts. 
 
  In full, the report:  
 
 Describes how the US wireless 
 carrier is shaping up. 
 Explores the effect of the fierce pricing wars 
 taking place, and the methods carriers are using to retain their&nbsp;subscribers. 
 
 Highlights the new technology carriers are using to drive growth and revenue.&nbsp; 
 
 Looks at the potential barriers that could limit carriers' growth and 
 examines who's best positioned&nbsp;to come out on top.

 Reuters    
 
  Keith Parker, UBS' chief US equity strategist, says millennial 
 investors have been scarred by the stock market turbulence throughout their 
 lives.  
  As part of a  wide-ranging interview , he offered some suggestions 
 for how millennials can better handle their investment future.

 set of investing circumstances. 
 The dot-com bubble of the early 2000s 
 was the first scar on their psyche, followed less than a decade later by 
 a financial crisis that saw the failure of multiple large US banks.    See

 HORRIFIC: Stephon Clark Was Shot 7 Times In Back By Sacramento Police
summary: 
text1:   
 Writing these articles never gets easier. In fact, sometimes I think it would 
 be better to just have a template: 
 "__ year old black man named _____________ 
 from __________, ________ was shot and killed last night.  Police claim 
 he was armed with a ____________ and they were in fear for their lives. 
  At this time, the police department will not release names of the officers 
 and no charges will be pursued against the officers involved" 
 Because 
 we know that is how it ends 99% of the time.   
 This time, the case is 
 just as horrific as all of the others.  On March 18th, a 22 year old black 
 man and father of 2, was just hanging out in the backyard of his grandmothers 
 house, holding his cell phone in his hand.  Cops were responding to a call 
 about cars in the neighborhood being vandalized and broken into.   
 The 
 shooting was captured on body cameras and on video from a police helicopter. 
 The footage shows Clark running to the backyard of his grandmother's house 
 where he was shot at 20 times by police.  Why? He wasn't running AT the 
 police. He was running AWAY.  And no one saw a weapon or even knew if he 
 was the person they were looking for. But being black and running from police 
 is enough reason to shoot, I guess.   read more

 Arbtr wants to create an anti-feed where users can only share one thing at

 At a time when the models of traditional social networks are being questioned, 
 it's more important than ever to experiment with alternatives. Arbtr is 
 a proposed social network that limits users to sharing a single thing at 
 any given time, encouraging "ruthless self-editing" and avoiding "nasty 
 things" like endless feeds filled with trivial garbage.

 The Gaza strip mourns its dead after protest is met with bullets
summary: 
text1:  
 Day of funerals and anger in wake of Israeli sniper fire as Palestinians 
 demand ?revenge?  The Gaza Strip is reeling from the bloodiest episode in 
 years after  Israeli forces killed more than a dozen people  during demonstrations 
 near the frontier. Gazans had gathered as part of a ?Great March of Return? 
 protest demanding refugees and their descendants be allowed to return to 
 their ancestral homes in Israel.    It was the start of a six-week sit-in, 
 and was advertised as a peaceful protest, expected to continue until 15 
 May when Palestinians commemorate the roughly 700,000 people who either 
 fled or were expelled from their homes in the war surrounding Israel?s creation 
 in 1948. As Israeli snipers opened fire, it quickly turned into bloody chaos.

 Manchester City tear through Everton to put one hand on Premier League title
summary:

 Manchester City?s glorious procession towards the Premier League title can 
 have the coronation it deserves. Victory number 27 was delivered in style 
 and comfort at Everton to leave Pep Guardiola?s team one win away from their 
 third championship in seven seasons. The Manchester derby at the Etihad 
 Stadium next Saturday could deliver a dream for the blue half of the city, 
 the stuff of nightmares for the red.  A Champions League quarter-final at 
 Liverpool beckons before then but City were not distracted from the target 
 of completing a clean sweep of triumphs over Premier League sides this season 
 as they brushed Sam Allardyce?s team aside at Goodison Park. Leroy Sané, 
 Gabriel Jesus and Raheem Sterling scored in the first half to extend City?s 
 haul to a remarkable 84 points from 31 matches. No other team has collected 
 so many points at this stage of a season. Few have cruised towards a championship 
 in such style. Securing the title with victory over José Mourinho?s United 
 would be a fitting way to complete a campaign of domestic dominance.   Continue

 How what seemed a routine case of ball tampering quickly escalated into a 
 national scandal that swept away Steve Smith, David Warner and Darren Lehmann 
 It all ended in tears. Quite often it does in cricket. If nothing else, 
 this week has been a reminder of the unique hold the game has on its players 
 and, in the case of Australia, an entire nation. Add Steve Smith, David 
 Warner and Darren Lehmann to a list of cricketers making tearful departures 
 that includes Michael Vaughan, Kim Hughes, Hansie Cronje and more surprisingly 
 ? and privately ? Brian Close when he was sensationally sacked by Yorkshire 
 in 1970.    Related:   Australia's ball-tampering scandal delivers bout

 Late motherhood is on the rise, but as one who knows, it has its downsides 
 | Yvonne Roberts
summary: 
text1:  
 Pregnancy rates have increased in only one age group ? fortysomethings ? 
 and with good reason In Aldous Huxley?s  Brave New World , published in 
 1932, only the savages, behaving like animals, became pregnant. ?Normal? 
 people had babies genetically designed, cloned and gestated in artificial 
 wombs, the age of the mother and father irrelevant to the process.  In the 
 real world, in 2018, we now have technological breakthroughs such as IVF, 
 and the growth of the ?mother machine? industry offers wombs for rent and 
 ?ovum donors? for those with the money to spend. This means that if a woman 
 wants a baby, alone or with a partner, now, as in fiction, age is no barrier.

 Ethan Sonneborn, age 13, has been running for governor of Vermont since October 
 2017. By all accounts, this is a very real campaign. Vermont is one of the 
 few states with zero age restrictions on who can run for office. But, his 
 candidacy is garnering new media attention in wake of the Parkland, Florida 
 school shooting. He&#x27;s now touting more gun control.&#xA0;According 
 to The Middlebury Campus newspaper, his message is one of optimism and encouragement 
 for young people to get engaged in politics.&#xA0; &#x22;Ethan Sonneborn,

 Can Peter Huber Investigate His Boss Rod Rosenstein?

 While it is reassuring to note that AG Jeff Sessions has climbed down from 
 the back side of the milk carton, where his missing visage had been hiding, 
 long enough to appoint Utah U.S. Atty. Peter Huber to independently investigate 
 claims of FBI abuses in surveilling the Trump campaign and other matters, 
 one question remains. Can he investigate his boss, Rod Rosenstein&#x92;s, 
 commission of a fraud upon the FISA court by signing a FISA warrant application 
 that relied on a fake British/Russian dossier financed by Team Hillary and 
 the DNC? It is about time we had someone who can convene...

 We've reviewed more over 40 sedans in the last 2 years ? here are the 4-doors 
 that impressed us the most
summary: 
text1:   
 Matthew DeBord/BI    
 
  SUVs have been surging, but there are still plenty 
 of great sedans on the market.  
  We've driven many four-doors over the 
 past few years.  
  Here are 12 of our favorites.  
 
 
  One of the big 
 stories in the car business over the past two years has been the realignment 
 of sales in the US. Pickup trucks have always done well, but as the market 
 was setting records in 2016 and 2017, SUVs were moving up while sedans were 
 moving down. At the  New York auto show , which opened to public on Friday, 
 there's  no shortage of SUVs for every purse and purpose on display . 
 
 Four-doors aren't the be-all, end-all products they once were, for both 
 mass-market and luxury brands. But for luxury brands in particular, mainstays 
 such as the BMW 3-Series and the Mercedes S-Class have been watching as 
 their SUV counterparts capture new buyers.&nbsp; 
 Does that mean that sedan 
 is dying? Not really. Ask anybody in the industry and they'll tell you that 
 Toyota Camrys and Honda Accords and even Chevy Malibus are still important 
 vehicles. Audi continues to take four-doors seriously. But it's also clear 
 that a customer can now start out with a small SUV and work his or her way 
 all they up to a big one, and never look twice at a sedan. 
 Too bad, as 
 there are some great ones for sale. We rounded up a dozen of the best:  
 Kia Stinger 
  Matthew DeBord/BI 
   Here's what I had to say about the 
 $52,000 test car in  our review :  
 
  The Stinger takes things to a whole 
 new level. This is easily the best car Kia has ever made, but more than 
 that, it's among the best cars of its type that I've driven. The comparison 
 that jumped immediately to mind was the&nbsp;  Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio 
  , a 505-horsepower beast that was a finalist for Business Insider's 2017 
 Car of the Year.  
  
   BMW 7-Series 
  Matthew DeBord/Business Insider 
 
  We were impressed enough the say in  our review  that the $90,000 bimmer 
 is "easily the finest 7 Series that BMW has ever built." 
 Plus, we named 
 it a finalist for our 2015 Car of the Year. The new 7-Series is basically 
 incredible. Crammed with technology and capable of BMW-level performance 
 and pure cruising comfort, it has reset expectations for what is probably 
 BMWs history least-loved car.  
   Audi A4 
  Hollis Johnson 
  In  our 
 review  of a $52,000 tester, BI's Ben Zhang wrote that the "Audi A4 is everything 
 you could want in a modern compact luxury sedan," adding that "it's the 
 best car Audi has ever made." 
 The A4 was a finalist for BI's 2017 Car 
 of the Year. It was also one onf those cars that we unanimously adored. 
 We literally couldn't find anything wrong with it. Nothing.&nbsp;

 There's a huge caveat in the US' expulsion of 60 Russian diplomats
summary: 
text1:   
 AP    
 
  The US' expulsion of 60 Russian diplomats in response to a chemical 
 attack on a former Russian spy in the UK, announced earlier this week, has 
 a huge loophole.  
  A State Department official confirmed that the US will 
 not require Russia to reduce the number of staff in its Washington embassy. 
  
  In other words, the 60 diplomats &mdash; many of whom were undercover 
 intelligence officers &mdash; who were kicked out can be replaced by others. 
  
  Targeted expulsions like this week's are not uncommon; the Obama administration's 
 move to expel 35 diplomats in 2016 was made under similar conditions.  
 
 
 
 President Donald Trump's administration announced this week that it 
 would expel 60 Russian diplomats from the US and close a Russian diplomatic 
 compound in Seattle in response to the poisoning of a former Russian spy 
 in the UK. 
 The nerve agent attack against former Russian military intelligence 
 officer Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia earlier this month is widely 
 believed to have been ordered by the Russian government. The White House's 
 expulsion, which was coordinated with similar expulsions of Russian diplomats 
 by more than 20 other countries, signaled a resounding rebuke from the West 
 against Russia's increasingly aggressive posturing.    See the rest of the

 I tested a $73,000 Cadillac XTS V-Sport sedan ? here's the verdict (GM)
summary: 
text1:  
 Matthew DeBord/BI    
 
  The  Cadillac  XTS V-Sport is a somewhat retro 
 sedan that still has performance cred.  
  It is big, comfy, and has a large 
 trunk &mdash; but it also has a powerful V6, twin-turbo engine.  
  The 
 Cadillac Cue infotainment system and the Bose audio setup make for blissful 
 highway cruising.  
 
 
  The Business Insider Transportation team is fortunate 
 in that we get to road test some extremely exciting cars. 
 But humans are 
 diverse in their desires, and spine-tingling performance isn't always what 
 we're looking for. Sometimes, we're looking for a ride that's just easy 
 in the old backbone. 
 My backbone is no longer exactly young, and over 
 the past few years, whenever an old-school, all-American freeway-cruising 
 machine has landed in my driveway, I've quietly rejoiced.&nbsp; 
 This happened 
 again last year when Cadillac loaned me a nice, big XTS V-Sport sedan.&nbsp; 
 
 It was so, so soothing. Here's why:  You can tell you're in for something 
 special when your 2018 Cadillac XTS Platinum V-Sport sedan with all-wheel-drive 
 arrives on a Stone Gray Metallic pain job and ... 
  Matthew DeBord/BI 
 
   ... with a Maple Sugar interior, with Jet Black accents. Maple sugar! 
 
  Matthew DeBord/BI 
   The Caddy came well-equipped. This trim level has 
 a base price of $71,695, with just about everything already included. Out 
 tester stickered at just over $73,000 thanks largely to a compact spare 
 tire that added $350. 
  Matthew DeBord/BI 
  Without all the V-Sport goodies, 
 the XTS comes in at about $46,000.

 Rory McIlroy: ?I?m not due anything, the Masters won?t just fall in your 
 lap?
summary: 
text1:  
 Northern Irishman has no time for those who say it is his destiny to wear 
 the Green Jacket but his recent form gives the four-times major winner cause 
 for optimism Rory McIlroy is aware of the allegation but the rebuttal is 
 firm. Mitigating circumstances aren?t typically factored in when a wait 
 for a major championship victory  stretching back to August 2014  ? and 
 an inability to capture the Masters ? are discussed. To the dissenters, 
 McIlroy has it too easy. Fame, money and marriage, it is said, have doused 
 his competitive instincts.  ?I don?t see that, because everyone else is 
 in the same boat,? McIlroy says. ?Everyone out here has a nice life, why 
 am I any different? Maybe I just portray more of a sense of happiness, I 
 don?t know. I am very happy and, whether I win or lose, I go home and I 
 have everything that&nbsp;I need but that doesn?t make me any&nbsp;less 
 motivated to go out and&nbsp;win.   Continue reading...

 Jürgen Klopp?s call for Anfield intensity against City has rich heritage

summary: 
text1:  
 Both the German and Manchester City?s Pep Guardiola are likely to be adventurous 
 in a Champions League quarter-final that will revive Liverpool memories 
 of great European battles of the past  Times have certainly changed since 
 the September night in 1978 when Nottingham Forest?s team coach rolled up 
 late to a European Cup tie at Liverpool with Bill Shankly sat up front alongside 
 Brian Clough. The players who usurped Liverpool as European champions that 
 season never asked Clough why he invited the Anfield icon on board, though 
 suspected it was part of their manager?s attempts to defuse the tension 
 and animosity that surrounded the visit to Bob Paisley?s holders. All-English 
 European ties have tended to carry a similar edge ever since. Anfield on 
 Wednesday will be no exception.    Related:   Six of the best from Manchester

 Schools funding crisis could swing election, union conference told
summary:

 Annual meetings of National Education Union and NASUWT focus on funding, 
 pay and PFI Teachers gathering at the National Education Union?s conference 
 in Brighton on Saturday were in a predictably angry mood. But there was 
 a growing sense that, finally, the notion that there is a funding crisis 
 in schools is breaking through with the general public.  Kiri Tunks, president 
 of the NEU branch that was known as the National Union of Teachers before 
  its merger with the Association of Teachers and Lecturers last year , enthusiastically 
 endorsed the idea that worries about school funding could swing votes: ?The 
 government didn?t expect that at all [at the last election] ? and it shows 
 we are a force to be reckoned with.?   Continue reading...

 Here are the laws that student gun-control activists from Parkland actually 
 want to pass
summary: 
text1:  
 Jonathan Ernst/Reuters    
 
  The national conversation about guns in America 
 has been hijacked in recent days by a controversy between a Fox News host 
 and David Hogg, one of the student leaders of the gun-control movement that 
 erupted following February's mass shooting at a high school in Florida. 
   
  Ingraham and Hogg traded barbs this week after the TV pundit personally 
 attacked Hogg for complaining about not getting accepted into a few universities. 
   
  But amid the feud, the debate over guns in America rages on.  
  Here's 
 what Hogg and other gun control activists are trying to achieve.   
 
 
 
 The  controversy  between Fox News host Laura Ingraham and a 17-year-old 
 Parkland shooting survivor and gun control activist whom she mocked on Twitter 
 continues to make headlines. 
 On Wednesday, Ingraham  tweeted a link to 
 a news article  about David Hogg having received rejection letters from 
 several California schools and said he "whines about it." 
 Hogg picked 
 up on Ingraham's comments,  tweeting  "Soooo @IngrahamAngle what are your 
 biggest advertisers...Asking for a friend.  # BoycottIngramAdverts." 
 Although 
 Ingraham later issued an apology to Hogg, the damage was already done. So 
 far,  a dozen companies  have withdrawn their advertisements from Ingraham's 
 show. 
 But amid the feud, the debate over guns in America rages on. 
 Earlier 
 this week, former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens  wrote an op-ed 
  in The New York Times urging a repeal of the Second Amendment. 
 Meanwhile, 
 the Never Again movement, a gun control advocacy group formed by Hogg and 
 fellow Parkland shooting survivors, continues its push for stricter gun 
 laws. 
 Here's exactly what they're pushing for:  Ban "assault weapons" 
 
  Joshua Roberts/Reuters 
  Gun control activists, particularly those who 
 attended the "March for Our Lives" rallies in cities across the US on March 
 24, frequently talk about banning assault weapons. 
 They often point to 
 the fact that assault weapons like AR-15-style rifles were used in the deadly 
 mass shootings in Parkland,  Las Vegas ,  Orlando ,  Connecticut , and  
 Texas . 
 But how such a proposal would actually work &mdash; and which 
 types of gun would be included in the ban &mdash; is  a lot more complicated 
  than it seems. 
 The National Rifle Association and many gun rights activists 
 believe that an assault weapons ban is a catch-all attempt to confiscate 
 most commonly owned firearms. 
 But David Hogg insists the Never Again Movement 
 "is not trying to take away your guns." 
 "We're trying to take back our 
 lives,"  he told The Outline , a digital media outlet. "Just as much as 
 you have a right to own a weapon, we have a right to liberty, we have the 
 right to peace, and we have the right to live."  
   Prohibit high-capacity 
 magazines 
  Joshua Roberts/Reuters 
  The  second legislative goal  the 
 "March for Our Lives" protestors want to accomplish is implementing a limitation 
 on the number of bullets a firearm can hold. 
 Though it's unclear what 
 exactly that limitation would be, high-capacity magazines are typically 
 defined as those that carry more than 10 rounds of ammunition. 
 On Friday, 
 for instance, lawmakers in Vermont  passed  a gun control law that banned 
 high-capacity magazines. It defined "high-capacity" as more than 15 rounds 
 for handguns and more than 10 rounds for all other firearms.  
   Close 
 background-check loopholes 
  Joshua Roberts/Reuters 
  There is currently 
  no federal law  mandating that buyers pass a background check when purchasing 
 a firearm online or at a gun show from a private, unlicensed seller. 
 The 
 gun control activists from Parkland and supporters of the "March for Our 
 Lives" wants to change that by  requiring  a background check "on every 
 gun sale, no exceptions." 
 It's worth nothing that some states have laws 
 requiring background checks for purchases from private, unlicensed dealers.

 **old article** Seems to be relevant after arrest of Raniere. Democratic 
 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton&#x27;s campaign already had the headache 
 of her husband&#x27;s close friendship with convicted sex offender and child 
 sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. Now it appears they may have a problem created 
 by their own candidate. A user of the social media website Reddit who backs 
 Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump claims to have unearthed evidence 
 that connects Hillary Clinton to convicted child abductor Laura Silsby. 
 The thread was started by Redditor &#x22;PleadingtheYiff,&#x22; who wrote:

 Brazil Considers Easing Extreme Gun Law, Allowing Self Defense
summary:

 Brazil has extremely strict gun control laws and relatively few firearms. 
 It is estimated there are about 17 million firearms in Brazil. Only 5.4 
 million are legally owned by private parties. 2.2 million are owned by the 
 military and police, and 9.5 million are illegally possessed.&#xA0; It would 
 take centuries of rigorous enforcement of gun confiscation to reach that 
 level in the United States, if it ever were possible. There are over 400 
 million firearms in private hands in the United States.&#xA0; A number comparable 
 to Brazil&#x27;s 17 million guns and 200 million people would be 28 million 
 guns...

 The 13 coolest car keys in the world

  Many manufacturers create brilliantly designed keys to 
 add to the experience of driving their cars.  
  Key wristbands, mobile 
 apps, and touchscreen keys are just a few of the innovative ways carmakers 
 are improving keys  
 
 
  The excitement around innovative car exteriors 
 often overshadows smaller details like a car key. But from simple,&nbsp;sleek 
 key fobs to high-tech designs that ditch the physical key all-together, 
 car makers are constantly trying to create keys as innovative and well-designed 
 as the cars themselves.&nbsp; 
 Here's a look at some of our favorite key 
 designs:&nbsp; 
  Business Insider's Aaron Brown wrote a &nbsp;previous 
 version  of this article.   Tesla's Model S key is shaped like a mini-Model 
 S, and has an option to pull the car forward and backward remotely, without 
 anyone in the car.

   This Ferrari key is simple and classic, 
 and all you have to do is slip it into your pocket to drive off.

 Insider/Cadie Thompson 
   McLaren's carbon fiber key makes it ultra-light, 
 with only three buttons adding to the simple lightweight design.

 AM Joy: Trump Can Be Indicted Later For Misuse Of Pardon Power
summary: 
text1:   
 The AM Joy panel discussed the history of the presidential pardon, starting 
 with Richard Nixon's pardon by President Gerald Ford.  
 "There's really 
 no evidence that they had an agreement," Paul Butler said. "Of course President 
 Ford suffered in the election. He was not re-elected in large part because 
 he had pardoned the president. " 
 "Absolutely. Same question similar to 
 you, Joe Conason," Reid said. "You're a scholar of the Clinton era. Was 
 there ever a consideration in the Clinton White House of using pardons to 
 extricate himself from the sort of Whitewater-to-Monica Lewinsky situation?" 
 
 "I don't believe there is any evidence that he thought of misusing pardons 
 that way," Conason said.  
 "It's important to remember Clinton was pursued 
 for years after he left the White House by the Justice Department under 
 President Bush for the pardons he issued to Mark Rich and Pincus Green, 
 which were suspected of being corrupt. There was never any proof they were.

 I tested a $73,000 Cadillac XTS V-Sport sedan ? here's the verdict (GM)
summary: 
text1:   
 The  Cadillac  XTS V-Sport is a somewhat retro sedan that still has performance 
 cred.  
  It is big, comfy, and has a large trunk &mdash; but it also has 
 a powerful V6, twin-turbo engine.  
  The Cadillac Cue infotainment system 
 and the Bose audio setup make for blissful highway cruising.  
 
 
  The 
 Business Insider Transportation team is fortunate in that we get to road 
 test some extremely exciting cars. 
 But humans are diverse in their desires, 
 and spine-tingling performance isn't always what we're looking for. Sometimes, 
 we're looking for a ride that's just easy in the old backbone. 
 My backbone 
 is no longer exactly young, and over the past few years, whenever an old-school, 
 all-American freeway-cruising machine has landed in my driveway, I've quietly 
 rejoiced.&nbsp; 
 This happened again last year when Cadillac loaned me 
 a nice, big XTS V-Sport sedan.&nbsp; 
 It was so, so soothing. Here's why:

 You can tell you're in for something special when your 2018 
 Cadillac XTS Platinum V-Sport sedan with all-wheel-drive arrives on a Stone 
 Gray Metallic pain job and ... 
 
   ... with a Maple Sugar interior, with 
 Jet Black accents. Maple sugar! 
 
   The Caddy came well-equipped. This 
 trim level has a base price of $71,695, with just about everything already 
 included. Out tester stickered at just over $73,000 thanks largely to a 
 compact spare tire that added $350. 
 
  Without all the V-Sport goodies, 
 the XTS comes in at about $46,000.

 We've reviewed more over 40 sedans in the last 2 years ? here are the 4-doors 
 that impressed us the most
summary: 
text1:   
 SUVs have been surging, but there are still plenty of great sedans on the 
 market.  
  We've driven many four-doors over the past few years.  
  Here 
 are 12 of our favorites.  
 
 
  One of the big stories in the car business 
 over the past two years has been the realignment of sales in the US. Pickup 
 trucks have always done well, but as the market was setting records in 2016 
 and 2017, SUVs were moving up while sedans were moving down. At the  New 
 York auto show , which opened to public on Friday, there's  no shortage 
 of SUVs for every purse and purpose on display . 
 Four-doors aren't the 
 be-all, end-all products they once were, for both mass-market and luxury 
 brands. But for luxury brands in particular, mainstays such as the BMW 3-Series 
 and the Mercedes S-Class have been watching as their SUV counterparts capture 
 new buyers.&nbsp; 
 Does that mean that sedan is dying? Not really. Ask 
 anybody in the industry and they'll tell you that Toyota Camrys and Honda 
 Accords and even Chevy Malibus are still important vehicles. Audi continues 
 to take four-doors seriously. But it's also clear that a customer can now 
 start out with a small SUV and work his or her way all they up to a big 
 one, and never look twice at a sedan. 
 Too bad, as there are some great 
 ones for sale. We rounded up a dozen of the best:   FOLLOW US:&nbsp; On

 Kia Stinger 
 
   
 Here's what I had to say about the $52,000 test car in  our review :  
 
 
  The Stinger takes things to a whole new level. This is easily the best 
 car Kia has ever made, but more than that, it's among the best cars of its 
 type that I've driven. The comparison that jumped immediately to mind was 
 the&nbsp;  Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio  , a 505-horsepower beast that 
 was a finalist for Business Insider's 2017 Car of the Year.  
  
   BMW 
 7-Series 
 
  We were impressed enough the say in  our review  that the 
 $90,000 bimmer is "easily the finest 7 Series that BMW has ever built." 
 
 Plus, we named it a finalist for our 2015 Car of the Year. The new 7-Series 
 is basically incredible. Crammed with technology and capable of BMW-level 
 performance and pure cruising comfort, it has reset expectations for what 
 is probably BMWs history least-loved car.  
   Audi A4 
 
  In  our review 
  of a $52,000 tester, BI's Ben Zhang wrote that the "Audi A4 is everything 
 you could want in a modern compact luxury sedan," adding that "it's the 
 best car Audi has ever made."

 More than 20% of manufacturers plan cuts while more than 58% plan price increases 
 to offset costs of leaving EU More than a fifth of manufacturing firms are 
 planning to lay off workers to cope with the costs of Brexit, according 
 to a survey that suggests the sector is already losing business.  More than 
 one in 10 (11%) of manufacturers say that they have already lost contracts, 
 according to Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply data shared with 
 the  Observer . Unions warned companies not to use Brexit as ?an excuse 
 to lay people off?. The figures have emerged as a group of cross-party MPs 
 and peers hope to persuade the government to reconsider its  determination 
 to leave the European Union?s customs union  ? a move causing serious concern

 links to Cambridge Analytica  ?Find Christopher Wylie.? That instruction 
 ? 13 months ago ? came from the very first ex-Cambridge Analytica employee 
 I met. He was unequivocal. Wylie would have answers to the two questions 
 that were troubling me most. He could tell me about Facebook. And he would 
 know about Canada.  What  Christopher Wylie  knows about Facebook, the world 
 now knows. Facebook certainly knows ? its market value is down $100bn. But 
 the Canadian connection remains more elusive. What it is. Why it matters. 
 And why it triggered my search for Wylie.   Continue reading...

 House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte appears on Fox News to discuss the

 within the FBI and DOJ. My notes follow the interview: Points to note: &#xE2;&#x99;&#xA6; 
 The flow of investigative documents from IG Horowitz to Goodlatte (congress) 
 slows down at the same time as Federal Prosecutor John Huber is appointed 
 by AG Jeff Sessions to parallel the Inspector General and look at the identified 
 criminal conduct. Duh. Why? Because releasing criminal evidence to congress, 
 in advance of indictments, would be nuts. &#xE2;&#x99;&#xA6; Prosecutor 
 John Huber can subpoena witnesses and...

 Amir Tsarfati&#x27;s update on the Gaza confrontation and the U.S. role in 
 Syria &#x26; more
summary: 
text1:   
 An excellent update that should not be missed for anyone following the current 
 scene at the Israeli border with Gaza, and also, even more important, a 
 spot-on discussion of America&#x27;s involvement in Syria. The UN&#x27;s 
 always anti-Israeli take on things, the Israeli F-35 surveillance flights 
 over Iran, the Saudi reaction to Trump&#x27;s comment on &#x22;soon&#x22; 
 removal of troops from Syria, and more. The Easter teaching comes tomorrow 
 and promises to be a beautiful one. Can&#x27;t wait. Happy Spring Holidays 
 to all, in my new PC vocabulary.

 The 13 coolest car keys in the world
summary: 
text1:  
 Many manufacturers create brilliantly designed keys to add to the experience 
 of driving their cars.  
  Key wristbands, mobile apps, and touchscreen 
 keys are just a few of the innovative ways carmakers are improving keys 
  
 
 
  The excitement around innovative car exteriors often overshadows 
 smaller details like a car key. But from simple, sleek key fobs to high-tech 
 designs that ditch the physical key all-together, car makers are constantly 
 trying to create keys as innovative and well-designed as the cars themselves.  
 
 Here's a look at some of our favorite key designs:  
  Business Insider's 
 Aaron Brown wrote a  previous version  of this article.    SEE ALSO:&nbsp; 
 These are the tech features you should get in your next car   
 Tesla's 
 Model S key is shaped like a mini-Model S, and has an option to pull the 
 car forward and backward remotely, without anyone in the car. 
 
   This 
 Ferrari key is simple and classic, and all you have to do is slip it into 
 your pocket to drive off. 
 
   McLaren's carbon fiber key makes it ultra-light, 
 with only three buttons adding to the simple lightweight design.

  What the public actually knows about China is very minimal 
 because of corruption, bias, and poor data availability.  
  Even the Chinese 
 government, led by President Xi Jinping, may not have a great hold on all 
 the information that the world's largest country needs.  
  China is trying 
 to use big data to get more accurate information about population, education 
 standards, and GDP.

 to hearing the retort "you don&rsquo;t know China!" spat at you by locals.

 We tried loaded fries from major fast-food chains to see who does it best 
 ? and the winner is shocking
summary: 
text1:  
 Hollis Johnson/Business Insider    
 
  Many fast-food chains have some form 
 of loaded fries on the menu.&nbsp;  
  We ranked loaded fries from the major 
 chains that offer them.  
  Amazingly,  Taco Bell  was found to have the 
 best loaded fries,&nbsp;despite only just  launching french fries  in January. 
  
 
 
  Loaded fries are the very definition of decadence. 
 Strips of fried 
 potato topped with copious unhealthy, yet delicious, additions like cheese, 
 bacon, chili, beef, or gravy &mdash; the breadth of options is limited only 
 by the scope of the imagination.&nbsp; 
 But as with any fast-food item, 
 there's a fine line to walk between decadence and disgusting. Too much cheese, 
 and they can become a soggy morass; too many toppings, and a gilded lily 
 can become a gilded mess. 
 Most fast-food chains have offered some form 
 of loaded fries over the years as a limited item, and a handful have them 
 on the menu permanently. Of the six fries we tried from four chains &mdash; 
 Arby's, Shake Shack, Taco Bell, and Wendy's &mdash; only one was a limited 
 item.&nbsp; 
 Six cheese-slathered, bacon-filled orders of loaded fries 
 later, we managed to rank them from worst to best &mdash; and the results 
 were pretty surprising.  6. Wendy's Baconator Fries 
  Hollis Johnson/Business 
 Insider 
   With the Baconator fries, a fork is 85% necessary. The topping 
 coverage is lackluster, and lots of bare fries are unearthed just below 
 the surface. Wendy's fries are typically on the floppy side anyway, so the 
 heat and moisture of cheese and condensation building in their little fries 
 greenhouse play only a partial factor in their sogginess.   
    Hollis 
 Johnson/Business Insider 
  On the plus side,&nbsp; they do manage to retain 
 heat for a fair amount of time. But they do not live up to the storied Baconator 
 name, for all its grease and glory. There's nothing to temper the extreme 
 richness of cheese and bacon &mdash; at least a Baconator has ketchup.&nbsp; 
   
   5. Shake Shack Cheese Fries 
  Hollis Johnson/Business Insider 
  
 Shake Shack's cheese fries are decadent at best and wanton at worst.&nbsp;The 
 cheese tastes like a fancy version of that nacho cheese that comes out of 
 a pump &mdash; that's a good thing in this instance. It's velvety smooth, 
 rich, and kind of buttery.

  While it has never been easier to work successfully 
 from home, there are a number of common pitfalls to avoid.   
  It is important 
 to leave the house and integrate social contact into your day &mdash; otherwise, 
 you may begin to feel reclusive.&nbsp;  
  By carefully scheduling your 
 day, changing out of your pajamas, and creating a designated work area, 
 it is possible to transform your living environment into a productive space.&nbsp; 
  
 
 
  After I graduated in 2010, I took an entry-level advertising sales 
 assistant job at a well-known print magazine. For the next six years, I 
 spent time bouncing from magazine to magazine across sales, marketing, and 
 editorial, desperately trying to find my niche in order to rise the ranks. 
   
  Turns out, my niche is at home. For the last two years, I've worked 
 for myself as an editorial and brand partnerships consultant for a variety 
 of media companies. This position combines all of those jack-of-all-trades 
 job functions into one lucrative role.   
  I used to dread going to the 
 office, and now I love my career. Self-discovery and revelations aside, 
 there's a roadmap to do it all right.   
  Here's what I wish I knew on 
 Day One:   1. Everyone thinks you're at home watching daytime TV 
  glenn

   Admittedly, my first day working from home 
 was a little bit terrifying. My first concern was how I would build out 
 my home cubicle environment. What were the rules? Could I turn on the TV? 
 Was it legal? Who would stop me?  
  I realized I was my own boss, and I 
 could do what works for me. I flop between daytime talk shows (no judgment 
 please) and CNN, with the intermittent episode of whatever HGTV show happens 
 to be on.   
  The background noise keeps me from going stir crazy, but 
 it also helps me feel like I'm not living in a bubble.   
   2. No one thinks 
 you're ever busy 
   Can you pick up a gift for me? Can you grab my dry 
 cleaning? Do you mind taking care of dinner? I often receive these kinds 
 of texts from friends and family. I usually say yes. Why? Not because I'm 
 a pushover, but because I sometimes feel guilty that I have created a position 
 where I'm my own boss and have my own freedom and schedule. There's no one 
 tying me to my desk or giving me a look when I take a long lunch or walk 
 out 10 minutes before 5 p.m.  
  Even though it may be easier to do so, 
 I've learned you can't always say yes. The only person I'm hurting is myself 
 &mdash; by losing my potential income for that hour of work. Although I 
 have significantly more freedom now than I did at my desk job, it still 
 doesn't mean that I'm not busy. In fact, I'm busier than I ever have been. 
 Sometimes you have to say no, and that's OK. They'll (hopefully) understand. 
  
 &nbsp;  
   3. You have to set a schedule 
  cathryn lavery/Unsplash 
 
   My first months freelancing, I thought I'd never get off the ground. 
 I was increasingly worried about my income, and though my supportive husband 
 helped us figure out a way to get by in the meantime, it was still so challenging. 
 I told myself I'd work traditional work hours. I would start my day at 9 
 a.m. and stop only when my husband came home for the evening. Sometimes 
 that was 6 p.m., but more often it was 9 p.m.   
  I must have sent off 
 hundreds of emails, which created a runway for me to really get things going. 
 Turns out that regimented schedule really worked at the beginning, but it 
 wasn't sustainable. These days, I typically work from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m., 
 which I find is my most productive part of the day. But, do you. Set    
 your    schedule.

 the party he had supported ?no longer exists?. Despite funding Labour under 
 three leaders before  Jeremy Corbyn ?s election to the post, he had now

 in the making tonight.  This is the first two current heavyweight champions 
 have fought against one another on British soil. It?s also only the second 
 time two undefeated heavyweight title-holders have faced off after the 1987 
 scrap between Mike Tyson (who held the WBA and WBC belts) and Tony Tucker

 less weight tonight. Joshua, at 242¼lbs, is more than 10lbs lighter than 
 he was for  October?s stoppage of Carlos Takam  ? and lighter than he?s 
 been for any fight since 2014.    10.04pm  BST      Hello and welcome to 
 tonight?s world heavyweight championship unification fight between Anthony 
 Joshua and Joseph Parker at Cardiff?s Principality Stadium.  The stadium 
 is packed once more for Joshua, who defended his titles successfully against 
 Carlos Takam here five months ago.   Joshua (20-0, 20 KOs), who holds the 
 IBF and WBA title, came in at 242¼lbs at yesterday?s weigh-in while Parker 
 (24-0, 18 KOs), who holds the WBO strap, tipped the scales at 236½ ? 10 
 pounds lighter than all three of his world championship bouts.   Continue

 Things hot up in the best episode of the series so far as Achilles? weakness 
 is exposed, the Gods get it wrong and Helen finally does something against 
 her own interests  Troy: Fall of a City finally produced an hour of TV that 
 captivated me from beginning to end. It helped that the stakes were as high 
 as they have ever been as the Trojans dealt with the aftermath of Hector?s 
 death (?He really was the best of men,? noted Priam, accurately if sadly) 
 and Achilles? refusal to return his body. That refusal led to Priam making 
 his own late-night journey into the Greek camp (security being notably lax 
 on both sides when the plot needs it to be) where he staged an uncomfortable 
 looking sit-in before confronting Achilles in a well-written scene, which 
 had the additional bonus of finally giving David Threlfall something to 
 do.   Continue reading...

 New Zealand v England: second Test, day three - live!
summary: 
text1:  
 New Zealand resume day three 192-6, still trailing England by 115 runs   
 Stuart Broad on form as tourists finally show some bite   Feel free to email 
  rob.smyth@theguardian.com      2.08pm  BST     Hello. Stuart Broad?s career 
 has been defined by matchwinning performances. There have been a dozen or 
 so in Tests, yet they have all occurred in two countries:  England and South 
 Africa . He might add New Zealand to the list in the next few days. A rejuvenated 
 Broad and the inevitable James Anderson look like England?s best hope of 
 drawing the series and ending their long run without a Test win overseas. 
 Welcome to England?s future; it looks quite a look like their past.  Broad?s 
 first task is to complete his first five-for since he routed South Africa 
 at Johannesburg in January 2016. He took four of the six wickets to fall 
 yesterday, and looked somewhere near his rampaging best. New Zealand will 
 resume on 192 for six, a deficit of 115, with the new ball due in 5.1 overs. 
 There will be more twists, as there always are in mid-scoring Tests. But 
 with Broad in this mood, England at least have a chance of victory.   Continue

 I haven't paid for cable in years ? here's how I keep up with TV without 
 it
summary:

 The  Insider Picks  team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business 
 Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from

 In order to continue to indulge my hobbies of going 
 to concerts and restaurants, I made a compromise for the sake of my wallet 
 and stopped paying for cable five years ago. 
 For me, a cable subscription 
 is ultimately not worth it. 
 I'm not a huge TV watcher in the first place, 
 but I like to check out my friends' show recommendations from time to time, 
 and I occasionally like to watch news and pop-culture events in real time. 
 
 My cord-cutting strategy has evolved over the years, and here I'll go 
 through the hardware and software that does and doesn't work for me, because 
 everybody is different. In some cases, you may be able to get away with 
 paying as little as $50 to replace your cable subscription for good.  My 
 streaming hardware of choice: It's a tie between Roku and Google Chromecast. 
 
  Instagram / @rokuplayer 
  If you watch a lot of TV, the first purchase 
 you're going to want to make is a streaming stick or box ( read our buying 
 guide here ). 
 I've had one plugged into my TV since 2010, and I can tell 
 you that this technology has improved significantly over the past eight 
 years. 
 These days,  I'm a big fan of Google's Chromecast . It's fast, 
 cheap, and reliable, but it comes with a potentially deal-breaking downside. 
 
 The Chromecast relies on you to stream media to it through your phone 
 instead of letting you navigate through a custom interface using a remote. 
 That's fine if you're on the geekier side (like me) and don't mind navigating 
 through streaming apps, but it can be tedious if you're not. 
 For people 
 who are more comfortable with traditional streaming hardware, I recommend 
  the Roku Express . It's even cheaper than  Chromecast , but it has its 
 own set of apps and comes with a remote. 
 Roku's streaming boxes and sticks 
 are the easiest to use in my experience &mdash;  I use the higher-end Roku 
 Ultra,  but the software powering both is the same. To that end, if you 
 have an ultra-high-definition TV, you should consider getting a 4K-capable 
 streaming box like the Roku Ultra or the Chromecast Ultra. 
  Roku Express, 
 $29.88, available at Amazon  
  Roku Ultra, $99, available at Amazon

   My HDTV antenna of choice: Mohu makes the best antennas 
 I've tried so far. 
  Amazon 
  To keep up with important news, sports games, 
 and pop-culture events, I broke down and got an HDTV antenna. I've used 
 a couple of models over the past two years, but I've recently switched to 
  a new model from Mohu  that has performed very well so far. 
 An HDTV antenna 
 connects to the same coaxial jack as your cable box but gives you free access 
 to any stations it picks up. You won't get premium channels, but if you're 
 within range, you will get CBS, ABC, NBC, Fox, local news affiliates, PBS, 
 and a handful of other channels in HD &mdash; if available &mdash; without 
 paying a dime. 
 That means that if your favorite shows always air on network 
 TV, you can cut the cord without missing out on watching them live. 
 The 
 only factor that distinguishes lower-end antennas from higher-end options 
 is their range, which matters quite a bit. If you're in a metropolitan area, 
 you can probably get away with a shorter-range antenna, but that's not the 
 case if you live somewhere more suburban or rural. I recommend consulting 
  TV Fool  and  AntennaWeb , two free services that will let you know which 
 channels you should be able to receive in your area. 
 Of all the tech I've 
 shown people, TV antennas always get the most positive response, as they're 
 easy to set up, save you money, and work surprisingly well. I brought one 
 over to a buddy's place to watch the Super Bowl last month, and everyone 
 kept asking how he was streaming the game without cable.

   My favorite 
 streaming services: I'm an Amazon Prime Video devotee, but I also see the 
 appeal of Sling TV for heavier cable-TV consumption. 
  Amazon 
  People 
 who have a Netflix or Hulu account &mdash; or a generous friend, relative, 
 or ex with one &mdash; will be able to transition right into leaning on 
 those instead of a cable box. 
  I rely on Amazon Prime Video , which has 
 a slightly smaller selection of streamable TV and movies but comes  bundled 
 with my Prime subscription . 
 I've  also tried Sling TV,  a service that 
 lets you stream a set of premium TV channels live over the internet. The 
 plans start at $20 a month for 25 channels, which you can augment with additional 
 packages for about $5 a pop. 
 Having a custom cable subscription to access 
 from any device at any time is great, but it ultimately was overkill for 
 me. 
 Sticking with a video service bundled into my one must-have subscription 
 has been just fine for me, but your experience may vary. And both  Amazon 
 Prime  and  Sling TV  have free trials for new subscribers, so if you'd 
 like to give each a try, you can sign up below.

   Airbnb  has changed the way many 
 people travel, including billionaires.&nbsp;  
  Renting private villas 
 has become increasingly popular among the world's richest people, according 
 to Nota Bene Global.  
  Airbnb-style luxury villa rentals cost between 
 $87,000 and $174,000 per week.&nbsp;  
 
 
 Airbnb has changed the way many 
 people travel, including billionaires.&nbsp; 
 Just ask Anthony Lassman, 
  cofounder of London-based, luxury travel- and lifestyle-management company&nbsp; 
  Nota Bene Global. &nbsp;Lassman&nbsp;and his wife Elaine have been offering 
 tailor-made, travel-planning services to the ultra-high net worth crowd 
 since launching Nota Bene in 2005.&nbsp; 
 "Ten to $20 million is the starting 
 wealth [of our clients]," Lassman told Business Insider. "Some of them I 
 know are worth between $1.5 to $8 billion," he said. 
 For billionaires, 
 the relative cost of a trip to Bali is like  buying a candy bar . But that 
 doesn't mean they're flippant about how they spend their money. 
 Lassman 
 says his clients "will pay it if they believe it's something very, very, 
 extraordinary."&nbsp; 
 That's why more than ever, Lassman is putting his 
 millionaire and billionaire clientele into private rented villas &mdash; 
 a type of Airbnb for billionaires &mdash; noting that the privacy and true 
 relaxation is worth the extremely high prices. 
 Luxury vacation rentals 
 in destinations like Greece and Italy typically cost between $87,155 to 
 $174,349 per week.&nbsp; 
 For Lassman, whose company previews all the villas 
 before offering them as an option to his clients, it's all about the quality. 
 "Nobody wants their money to be taken for granted. Nobody wants to feel 
 you're just billing them for huge sums of money without being able to justify 
 it." 
 Ahead, a look at a few truly stunning, remote villas that you won't 
 find on Airbnb &mdash; and that only the super rich can afford to rent out.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;  Italian Lakes Villa: around $105,847 per week.

 [Catholic Caucus] Cardinal says Church teaching doesn&#x92;t put any specific 
 person in Hell
summary: 
text1:   
 After Pope Francis was cited by an Italian journalist as saying that Hell 
 doesn&#x92;t exist, Cardinal Vincent Nichols of Westminster in the U.K. 
 took to the BBC to say that what Francis may have had in mind is the imagery 
 of Hell as a place of endless fire and torment, which, the cardinal insisted,

 at risk of having their speech silenced by large and powerful private institutions. 
 This silencing can take the form of demonetization, shadow bans or actual 
 bans on the various social media platforms like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. 
 Public figures like Jordan Peterson, Steven Crowder, Sargon of Akkad, Tommy 
 Robinson, Milo Yiannopoulos and many others have had their speech restricted 
 by these large technology companies. As an advocate of free markets, I have

 Who stands to gain if Trump pulls the US out of Syria?
summary: 
text1:   
 President Donald Trump&#x27;s unexpected announcement on Thursday that the 
 US would &#x22;be coming out of Syria like very soon&#x22; is raising concerns 
 among some national security officials who warn that withdrawing now would 
 not only undermine American credibility in the region but prompt a significant 
 escalation to an already devastating conflict. While Trump has often touted 
 the gains made against ISIS since taking office, his latest comments caught 
 much of his own administration off-guard -- including defense officials 
 who have warned that now is not the time to withdraw from Syria. &#x22;We&#x27;re 
 knocking the hell out of ISIS. We&#x27;ll be...

summary: 
text1:   
 This week, parents in one state can breathe a sigh of relief. Utah Governor 
 Gary Herbert has made parenting a lot easier by signing a bill that legalizes 
 &#x93;free-range&#x94; parenting. Free-range parenting allows children to 
 play without the constant and close supervision of their parents or another 
 adult. Devotees believe children benefit from more freedom and learn vital 
 decision making skills while playing at parks, walking to school, or wandering 
 the neighborhood, without a parent hovering over them. The bill&#x92;s sponsor, 
 Utah state Senator Lincoln Fillmore recognized the benefits of free-range 
 parenting saying, &#x93;kids need to wonder about the world,...

 This is no joke. This is the most serious--and yet at the same time, the

 Trump declares April &#x27;Sexual Assault Awareness&#x27; month
summary:

 Washington (AFP) - US President Donald Trump -- who has himself been repeatedly 
 accused of sexual misconduct -- on Friday designated April 2018 &#x22;National 
 Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month&#x22; amid a national debate 
 over the issue. &#x22;Sexual assault crimes remain tragically common in 
 our society, and offenders too often evade accountability,&#x22; said a 
 proclamation from Trump released by the White House. &#x22;These heinous 
 crimes are committed indiscriminately: in intimate relationships, in public 
 spaces, and in the workplace.&#x22; &#x22;Too often, however, the victims 
 of assault remain silent. They may fear retribution from their offender, 
 lack faith in the justice system,...

 Zlatan Ibrahimovic scores 2 absurd goals in MLS debut including stoppage

summary:

 @MLS / Twitter    
 
  Zlatan Ibrahimovic announced his arrival in MLS with 
 two stunning goals to help the LA Galaxy comeback to win after being down 
 3-0.  
  His first goal was a blast from 38 yards out, just five minutes 
 after he took the field as a substitute in the 71st minute.  
  Ibrahimovic 
 had only landed in Los Angeles on Thursday, and had had just one training 
 session with his new team before taking the pitch.   
 
 "Dear Los Angeles, 
 you're welcome." 
 That's how the braggadocious  Zlatan&nbsp;Ibrahimovic 
 announced his arrival  in the MLS after agreeing to join the LA Galaxy. 
 And while some might've found such a bold proclamation unwise, it didn't 
 take much for Zlatan, who  once compared himself to God , to back up his 
 words on the pitch.    See the rest of the story at Business Insider   NOW

  When asking for a raise or negotiating the salary 
 for a new job, you'll want to choose your words strategically.&nbsp;  
 
  Salary negotiations are collaborations, and successful collaborations require 
 good communication &mdash; so you'll need to be very clear.&nbsp;  
  But, 
 you should avoid disclosing your current salary, referring to what you want 
 as "desired" or "wanted," and using negative words.&nbsp;  
 
 
 You're 
 96% sure that you are ready to schedule a meeting with your boss to ask 
 for a raise. Or perhaps you're nearing the end of the job interview process 
 and an offer is in sight. However, if you're like me, you have definitely 
 put your foot in your mouth a time or two &nbsp;  saying the wrong thing 
  &nbsp; at the absolute worst moment. Doh!

 "Unlike others, they pay

 others, they pay little or no taxes to state &amp; local governments, use 
 our Postal System as their Delivery Boy (causing tremendous loss to the 
 U.S.), and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business! 
 Trump 
 has a  history of criticizing Amazon . The president  argues  that Amazon&nbsp;has 
 unfairly received prime tax benefits and preferential treatment from the 
 US Postal Service,&nbsp;hurting brick-and-mortar retailers. 
 While Amazon 
 denies that its aggressive growth hurts competitors, many analysts and executives 
 agree that, often, when Amazon enters a new industry, rivals suffer. 
 These 
 are eight industries that have been threatened by Amazon's increasing domination:&nbsp; 
  Food delivery businesses 
  Blue Apron 
  Blue Apron's disastrous IPO reveals 
 how big of an impact Amazon's entrance in a new industry can have on competitors.&nbsp; 
 
 The company went public in June. When Amazon filed a trademark application 
 for "prepared food kits" on July 6, Blue Apron's stock  sank 11%.  
 Amazon's 
 success has continued to plague Blue Apron.  In January,  the company's 
 shares fell more than 6% after&nbsp;One Click Retail's&nbsp;2017 Grocery 
 Report showed that Amazon had made impressive gains in the US grocery market.&nbsp;

  As customers shop for shoes directly 
 from Amazon,  analysts say &nbsp;companies like Foot Locker and Finish Line 
 are in danger.&nbsp;In August 2017, UBS analyst Michael Binetti downgraded 
 both companies, saying it is "almost certain" that sneaker retailers will 
 lose market share to Amazon. 
 "The disruption that has characterized the 
 retail industry recently is not going away," Foot Locker's CEO Richard Johnson 
 said  in a call with investors in February.  "Consumers want experiences, 
 they want cool products, and they want it all &mdash; fast." 
 Foot Locker 
 plans to close approximately 110 stores this year after closing 147 stores 
 globally in 2017.&nbsp;

  Amazon bought Whole Foods in August 2017, which dealt a massive blow to 
 US grocery stores as it forced its way into the brick-and-mortar market 
 and threatened to drive prices down. 
 The retailer is already the largest 
 seller of groceries online. It's estimated to have &nbsp;  18% of the US 
 &nbsp;online grocery market, which is double the second-place share held 
 by Walmart. 
 By having access to brick-and-mortar locations, the company 
 is able to expand its reach across the US and use these stores as distribution 
 centers for online orders. And, Amazon is building out its own brick-and-mortar 
 concept, with the  first Amazon Go store  opening in Seattle in January.&nbsp;

 WASHINGTON, DC ? Professor Jonathan Turley, a top national legal expert on 
 government prosecutions, commented on Thursday about Attorney General Jeff 
 Sessions? decision to bring in U.S. Attorney John Huber. Turley called it 
 ?brilliant? to combine all the powers of the U.S. Department of Justice?s 
 inspector general with a prosecutor who can bring charges, seek indictments, 
 and get results far more quickly than a second special counsel, which will 
 lead to swifter results for President Trump.

 WHERE ARE THEY NOW? Michael Jordan's legendary North Carolina NCAA championship 
 team
summary: 
text1:  
 Ellen Ozier/Reuters    
 The University of North Carolina Tar Heels cut down 
 the nets at last year's NCAA tournament, adding yet another title to the 
 program's prestigious history.&nbsp; 
 Of all of North Carolina's title 
 winning teams, however, none may be more iconic than the 1982 National Championship 
 team. Led by legendary coach Dean Smith, and with a roster boasting some 
 of the greatest players ever &mdash; indeed, perhaps &nbsp;the greatest&nbsp; 
 player ever &mdash; the '82 Heels won a thrilling, down-to-the-wire contest 
 against the Georgetown Hoyas to claim the title.&nbsp; 
 Below, we take 
 a look at some of the key contributors to that team, as well as where they 
 went after that iconic game.&nbsp;  James Worthy was the top player on the 
 1982 team, winning the National Player of the Year and Final Four Most Outstanding 
 Player awards that year. 
  AP 
   Worthy went on to have a Hall of Fame 
 NBA career as a part of the Showtime Lakers. He currently works as a Lakers 
 TV analyst. Fun fact, he also once had a cameo on "Star Trek: The Next Generation." 
 
  Harry How/Getty Images 
   Michael Jordan was a freshman on the 1982 
 Tar Heels team, and he played a pivotal role averaging 13.5 points per game. 
 He also hit the game-winning shot against Georgetown in the title game.

 Why the universe shouldn't exist at all
summary: 
text1:   
 "Why is there something, rather than nothing?" could be the oldest and deepest 
 question in all of metaphysics.  Long exclusively the province of philosophy, 
 in recent years this question has become one that can be addressed by scientific 
 methods. What's more, a new scientific advance has made it more likely that 
 we will finally be able to answer this cosmic conundrum.  This is a big 
 deal, because the simplest scientific answer to that question is "We shouldn't 
 exist at all."

 The 25 schools that make the most money in college basketball
summary: 
text1:  
 The Louisville Cardinals men's basketball team has been wrecked with scandal 
 recently, and even&nbsp; had to vacate its most recent title.  
 The good 
 news for the Cardinals, however, is they are still the richest men's college 
 basketball program in the country. Based on the most recent data, the Cardinals 
 have the highest revenue of any program in the country, and it is not even 
 that close. 
 But Louisville isn't the only scandal-ridden program raking 
 in the money. 
 The Arizona Wildcats are also near the top. Their head coach, 
 Sean Miller,  was reportedly caught on an FBI wire tap discussing the $100,000 
 payment to secure the commitment from a top recruit .

 A feeling of shock in Salisbury has drawn more people to Easter services

 has marked the drama of Holy Week and Easter in the same way ? with services 
 focusing on suffering, death and resurrection. But this year there is a 
 special poignancy to the prayers.  The people of Salisbury are remembering 
 the plight of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, the Russians who collapsed just 
 a short distance away from the cathedral, following a  nerve agent attack 
  blamed on the Russian state.   Continue reading...

 The owners of nearly 100,000 empty or second homes in England are paying 
 reduced or no council tax on their properties despite the cash crisis facing 
 local authorities, it has emerged.  Almost 80,000 empty houses have been 
 enjoying council tax deductions, according to official government figures 
 seen by the  Observer , with nearly half of the properties having no council 
 tax applied to them at all. Owners of more than 19,000 second homes were 
 also given money off their council tax bills.   Continue reading...

 Contacts is an exhibition of rare and never-before-seen contact sheets by 
 some of the world?s greatest music photographers at the  Lucy Bell Gallery 
 .  In June 1977,   Bob Marley  took a day off from the European leg of his 
 Exodus tour to visit the photographer Allan Ballard at his studio in Primrose 
 Hill, north London. Marley was said to dislike studio-based shoots and only 
 did a couple in his lifetime, but on that day Ballard found him in playful 
 mood, willing to strike a pose.  Today most of the images we see of Marley 
 come from the same few photographs, with the singer looking composed, eyes 
 closed, deific. Those three or four shots are the basis for almost every 
 mural, album cover and student poster of him ? but do little to reveal the 
 person.   Continue reading...

 After the Cambridge Analytica data-breach row many users are looking to switch 
 their social media accounts. What sites and apps could prove an option? 
 For too many people considering leaping aboard the #DeleteFacebook bandwagon, 
 the answer is simple: switch your photo and video sharing to Instagram and 
 your messaging to WhatsApp. But what many do not realise is that both of 
 those apps are owned by Facebook ? since September 2012 and October 2014 
 respectively.  It is a mark of the company?s dominance of the social media 
 landscape ? Facebook has 2.13 billion monthly active users, WhatsApp 1.5 
 billion and Instagram 800 million ? that finding a single alternative is 
 difficult.   Continue reading...

 is surprisingly emotional You see them everywhere. Kitted out in form-hugging 
 Lycra, cycling in groups down leafy lanes, racing past buses on crowded 
 roads, chatting on corners. Now they?re on cinema screens, too. A  documentary 
 film  out next week aims to capture the Mamil (middle-aged man in Lycra) 
 experience, almost a decade after the phenomenon began.  ?I wanted to examine 
 what life is like today for middle-aged men,? says the film?s Australian 
 director Nickolas Bird. ?What makes them tick and what pressures they?re 
 under ? I also wanted to explore topics like masculinity, men?s health, 
 how men support each other and how minority groups and women fit into the 
 Mamil world.?   Continue reading...

 nothing,? he announced, mid-performance at London?s Wireless festival.

 Love, Simon: at last Hollywood is saying ?I?m gay?
summary: 
text1:  
 As social attitudes evolve, mainstream cinema has begun to treat gay love 
 stories like any other romance. Love, Simon proves the point The coming-out 
 movie, commonly found on the film festival or arthouse circuit rather than 
 at a multiplex, has always been a reliable source of angst. For a sign of 
 how times have changed, try this: at a London preview last week of   Love, 
 Simon  , a glossy rom-com about a US high-school student (Nick Robinson) 
 inching slowly out of the closet, audience members were invited to ride 
 a giant  Love, Simon  ferris wheel in Leicester Square in homage to the 
 film?s giddy, fun-fair climax. There were few takers ?well, it was raining 
 ? but that?s not the point. Even  Beautiful Thing  in 1996, which represented 
 the previous benchmark for making a mainstream coming-out story that wouldn?t 
 scare the horses, never had a ferris wheel erected in its honour.  Money 
 makes a big difference. With the corporate clout of 20th Century Fox behind 
 it,  Love, Simon  is the first gay teen movie from a major studio. In its 
 eagerness to please (Simon?s opening line is: ?I?m just like you?) and its 
 relentless upbeat jauntiness, the film makes  Beautiful Thing  look like 
 Fassbinder. Breakthroughs come in different shapes and sizes, though, and 
 it would be unfair to disparage this hugely entertaining picture simply 
 for being big and fluffy and pink.   Continue reading...

 ? Briton wins 118-110, 118-110 and 119-109 on judges? cards ? 28-year-old 
 now holds three of four major title belts Anthony Joshua, taken the distance 
 for the first time in 21 paid bouts, collected a third world title belt 
 when he cruised to a convincing if drama-free win over the WBO champion, 
 Joseph Parker, and looks in good shape to raise his game for what will be 
 a more demanding assignment against Deontay Wilder.  Two of the judges saw 
 it 118-110, and the third had it 119-109 ? a bit harsh on the New Zealander, 
 who might have had a share of the sixth and a shout of stealing the seventh 
 in a fleeting period of success. But the verdict was, overall, fair. It 
 was a technical fight, a clinical victory.   Continue reading...

 The data-mining scandal offers a unique chance to reclaim our private information

 public trust in Facebook  is welcome news to those of us who have been warning 
 about the perils of ?data extractivism? for years.  It?s reassuring to have 
 final, definitive proof that beneath Facebook?s highfalutin rhetoric of 
 ?building a global community that works for all of us? lies a cynical, aggressive 
 project ? of building a global data vacuum cleaner that sucks from all of 
 us. Like others in this industry,  Facebook makes money by drilling deep 
 into our data selves  ? pokes and likes is simply how our data comes to 
 the surface ? much like energy firms drill deep into the oil wells: profits 
 first, social and individual consequences later.   Continue reading...

 Kiss Me First marks return to TV for Skins co-creator Bryan Elsley
summary: 
text1:  
 Writer of cult TV show keeps the teenage connection with adaptation of Lottie 
 Moggach?s young adult sci-fi novel The hit TV show   Skins   offered what 
 some viewers felt was a sordid look at the world of teen drinking, eating 
 disorders, drugs, divorcing parents and clubbing. Yet it paved the way to 
 A-list film stardom for a string of young actors, from Oscar nominees Daniel 
 Kaluuya and Dev Patel, to the acclaimed Jack O?Connell, Nicholas Hoult, 
 and Kaya Scodelario, who went on to star in the  Maze Runner  and  Pirates 
 of the Caribbean  blockbuster franchises.  The controversial and cult drama 
 series, which was set in Bristol and ran on E4 between 2007 and 2013, nurtured 
 such a long list of screen talent it scarcely looks credible now. Five years 
 on, Bryan Elsley, the Scottish writer behind  Skins , is on the eve of unveiling 
 his next show, a big budget thriller called   Kiss Me First   that has taken 
 him four years to make.   Continue reading...

 Dover turns clock back a century to welcome home Unknown Soldier ? again
summary: 
text1:  
 Sir Michael Morpurgo is supporting a large-scale public performance to honour 
 the warrior at the spot where his body returned to British soil In 1916, 
 the Rev David Railton, a former curate in Folkestone, was serving as a chaplain 
 on the western front in France when he came across a makeshift grave in 
 the back garden of a house at Armentières. The wooden cross above it bore 
 the pencilled words ?An Unknown British Soldier?.  Two years later, after 
 armistice, Railton remembered that simple cross and suggested Britain might 
 commemorate its own unknown warrior as a symbol of the many anonymous dead 
 left in France. This November, a century after the first world war ended, 
 the port of Dover is to stage a large-scale theatrical event to commemorate 
 the arrival of that chosen soldier?s body back in Britain. The planned performance, 
 announced in the  Observer  today, will involve drama, music, dance, digital 
 art and a simulated ?time tunnel?, and will be led by the Marlowe theatre 
 in Canterbury.   Continue reading...

 there are several compelling arguments for declining to foot the bill for 
 your child's education.  
  It can help your child to understand the value 
 of money and build a healthy relationship with it early on.&nbsp;

 as supporting your child's high-school education and researching scholarships.&nbsp;

  If a college 
 education helps you get to where you want to be professionally    and   
  if you can afford it, then you go ahead and earn that college degree! I 
 spent six years in college and graduate school and benefitted hugely from 
 both experiences. So I'd love to see my son succeed in higher education.

 75 students at Rockledge High School in central Florida walked out of class 
 in support of the Second Amendment on Friday. The students say they felt 
 &#x22;silenced&#x22; last week when students walked out in support of gun 
 control.Fox News: &#x93;I&#x92;m pro-Second Amendment,&#x94; Rockledge junior 
 and protest organizer Anna Delaney told the station. &#x22;I wouldn&#x92;t

 The Importance of the Resurrection
summary: 
text1:   
 By Philip Cottraux Since I upload blogs every Saturday, I usually write my 
 yearly Easter messages between Good Friday and Easter. This often gives 
 me the unique opportunity to focus on both the crucifixion and resurrection 
 of Christ. The two are inseparable from one another as the central point 
 of Christianity. This year, I want to focus on why the resurrection itself

 Knife Violence on the Rise in Germany (But we can learn something from the

summary: 
text1:   
 While this country is embroiled in a shouting match over gun violence, Germany 
 finds itself in an internal debate about the rise in knife violence. Unlike 
 this country, though, many in Germany seem to be focused on finding the 
 root cause and, hence, the solution. As The Local reports of Germany, &#x22;police 
 statistics [show] that refugees and asylum seekers are significantly over-represented 
 in violent crime statistics.&#x22;Titled &#x22;String of knife attacks further 
 fuels debate over refugees and violence,&#x22; the article begins by listing 
 a series of violent knife attacks. Almost all of the attacks were done by 
 male teenage refugees....

 7 Thought-Provoking Songs About the Crucifixion
summary: 
text1:   
 For the hundreds of millions of Christians who observe Holy Week, the Friday 
 before Easter is a time of solemn reflection on the crucifixion of Jesus. 
 Known as &#x22;Good Friday,&#x22; the day is often marked by special worship

 particular order, are seven thought-provoking music pieces that focus on 
 the cross. 1. O Sacred Head Now Wounded The exact origins of...
